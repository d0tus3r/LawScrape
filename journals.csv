[{'title': 'Administrative Law in an Era of Partisan Volatility', 'fulltext_url': 'https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/69/1/livermore-richardson.pdf', 'abstract': 'Contemporary politics is characterized by a polarized national discourse, weak party organizations, volatile control of government, and an increasingly assertive executive. These political dynamics interact with a system of administrative law inherited from different political times that is ill-suited to addressing the risks of the current moment, which include threats to administrative values such as efficiency, impartiality, and expertise; to democratic values such as accountability, transparency, and participation; and, most generally, to the ability of the law to benefit social well-being through sound policymaking. In recent years, some legal scholars have become attuned to the interaction between administration and these features of the political environment. Unfortunately, administrative law itself has been slow to catch up, with potentially dangerous consequences for the stable functioning of the U.S. administrative state. Drawing from the political science literature that examines the interacting features of organized politics that generate stable party systems, we examine how prior administrative law regimes have responded to political transformations in the past. With this research in view, we find that administrative law as it stands today, which emerged during an earlier party system, is ill-suited to meet the challenges of modern politics. Time will tell whether courts will shape doctrine to better align administrative law with the needs of the times.', 'author': ['Michael', 'A.', 'Livermore', '&', 'Daniel', 'Richardson'], 'document_type': 'article', 'issue': '1', 'volume': '69', 'journal': 'Emory Law Journal', 'first_page': '1', 'orginal_url': 'https://law.emory.edu/elj/content/volume-69/issue-1/articles/administrative-law-era-partisan-volatility.html\n'}, {'title': 'The Costs of Changing Our Minds', 'fulltext_url': 'https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/69/1/farahany.pdf', 'abstract': 'The neuroscience revolution poses profound challenges to the doctrine of avoidable consequences in tort law and exposes deep theoretical riddles about the right to our own mental experiences and memories. To address this profound question, this Article begins with a deceptively simple principle of tort law: A victim of tortious wrongdoing by another is held responsible for mitigating her own physical injuries. This Article addresses whether that same doctrine should require a tort victim to likewise mitigate her emotional injuries. The answer to that question is of great and increasing importance because it goes to the heart of how society should address dramatic advances in neuroscience that enable us to change our own minds. This Article proposes a revolutionary way to understand both the answer to this question and to bring daylight to many puzzling doctrines in law—through the right to cognitive liberty. Through an introduction to the groundbreaking concept of cognitive liberty, the confusion plaguing the doctrine of avoidable consequences in tort law for emotional distress injuries is solved and new insights are developed with respect to other doctrines in law. These implications are as far-ranging as the deliberative privilege afforded to judges to the forced competency of prisoners. It quickly becomes apparent that cognitive liberty is the interest upon which many of our most cherished freedoms are secured.', 'author': ['Nita', 'A.', 'Farahany'], 'document_type': 'article', 'issue': '1', 'volume': '69', 'journal': 'Emory Law Journal', 'first_page': '75', 'orginal_url': 'https://law.emory.edu/elj/content/volume-69/issue-1/articles/costs-changing-our-minds.html\n'}, {'title': 'State Constitutions as a Check on the New Governors: Using State Free Speech Clauses to Protect Social Media Users from Arbitrary Political Censorship by Social Media Platforms', 'fulltext_url': 'https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/69/1/okelley.pdf', 'abstract': 'Social media platforms like Facebook are increasingly the arbiters of what political viewpoints get the light of day. As more people become active on social media, including using it as a primary news source, and as political speech increasingly moves onto these platforms, they will continue amassing the power to control news narratives, the size of speakers’ bullhorns, and the ideas that get discussed. Moreover, these platforms will likely face increasing external pressures to silence certain viewpoints deemed objectionable or offensive, whatever those views may be. The United States Constitution provides no check on this power. As private actors, social media platforms can ban whatever speech they want, and for whatever reason, subject only to market pressures. Simply, the First Amendment, based on its text and longstanding precedent, does not apply. There may be another way to safeguard speech online, however. This Comment proposes looking to a different source of law, one all too often overlooked in litigation and scholarship: state constitutions. Nearly all state constitutions have free speech clauses that are textually different from the First Amendment in ways suggesting state action requirements can be softened or even jettisoned. Moreover, a handful of states have interpreted their free speech clauses as being broader than the First Amendment and applying to certain private actors—an approach with express approval by a unanimous United States Supreme Court. This case law provides reasoning applicable to a new and modern dilemma: the gravitation of political speech to social media platforms.', 'author': ['Elijah', "O'Kelley"], 'document_type': 'comment', 'issue': '1', 'volume': '69', 'journal': 'Emory Law Journal', 'first_page': '111', 'orginal_url': 'https://law.emory.edu/elj/content/volume-69/issue-1/comments/constitutions-check-governors-free-speech-social-media-censorship.html\n'}]
