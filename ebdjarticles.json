Thus, the reach and force of the Code is further limited by the discrepancy between individual states\u00bf definitions of marriage and DOMA. Thus, the steady decline in marriage rates and the continued rise in nontraditional familial units leave the Code out of step with American society.",

This power, commonly known as \u00bfcramdown,\u00bf is constrained by the Fair and Equitable Rule. After enactment of the current Bankruptcy Code, one part of that rule has been a general prohibition against cramming down all-equity plans on prepetition secured creditors. But recent case law\u00bfspecifically Philadelphia Newspapers\u00bfprovides an opening to debtors who wish to strip away a secured creditor\u00bfs lien. This Article demonstrates that such all-equity plans should not be confirmed because valuation uncertainty exposes junior and senior creditors alike to unjustifiable risks that are not present in lien retention plans.",

        "abstract": "While the United States has been able to protect the growth of intellectual property within its own borders, especially in the context of the Code, the increasingly global economy has left these protections ineffective in international insolvency cases. Current law leaves intellectual property licenses vulnerable to foreign laws that allow debtors to unilaterally and completely cancel the license, contrary to United States law. This severely threatens the continuing growth of intellectual property in the United States. This Comment suggests that \u00a7 1506 allows courts to deny comity where needed to protect intellectual property licenses. Doing so will ensure the security of such licenses in a chapter 15 case, thereby promoting a robust licensing market and ultimately encouraging continued investment in the development of intellectual property in the United States.",

To strip off, a debtor must file a motion separate from the plan confirmation pursuant to Rule 3012. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled on the issue of adversary proceeding requirements in bankruptcy. In United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. Espinosa, the Court decided two important issues applicable to whether strip-off requires an adversary proceeding: (1) the Supreme Court\u00bfs decision in Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co. sets the constitutional requirement for due process in bankruptcy; and (2) res judicata can bar the appeal of a confirmed plan even though an adversary proceeding was not initiated as required by the Bankruptcy Rules. The Supreme Court\u00bfs decision in Espinosa reinforces the Comment\u00bfs interpretation that a motion is required for a strip-off.",

        "abstract": "The Comment proposes that, for doctrinal and practical reasons, determinations of equitable mootness should be reviewed for an abuse of discretion. However, numerous scholars have recognized that the deference granted under the abuse of discretion standard is more of a spectrum than a single, easily definable standard. Therefore, the Comment also suggests that courts of appeals should be more willing to overturn determinations of equitable mootness than other issues reviewed for an abuse of discretion.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/ebdj/_documents/volumes/29/1/articles/goralnik.pdf",
        "abstract": "The \"hanging paragraph\" in Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 1325(a) requires many debtors hoping to retain a vehicle under a chapter 13 plan to repay the full value of their auto lender's secured claim, even if that claim is undersecured. This protection is limited to creditors with a purchase-money security interest in the debtor's vehicle. Accordingly, bankruptcy courts reviewing a chapter 13 plan must consider the validity of an objecting creditor's purchase-money security interest. This issue has proven controversial in cases where the lender financed both the debtor's newly purchased vehicle and excess debt (\"negative equity\") a trade-in vehicle. The highly general language of the Uniform Commercial Code affords few clues to the purchase-money status of financed negative equity. To break the impasse, this Article draws on heretofore-neglected evidence from the UCC's text and drafting history that lends substance to the \"consumer compromise\" embodied in Revised Article 9. These materials indicate that the UCC maintains strict requirements for according purchase-money status to a consumer loan, and would not accord purchase-money status to financed negative equity. If this conclusion is at odds with the expectations of the drafters of the hanging paragraph, it suggests that they erred in hinging the applicability of a rule of federal bankruptcy law on a loan's purchase-money status under state law.",

        "abstract": "Stern v. Marshall is the most recent decision in a series of cases decided by the Supreme Court that involves the doctrine of public rights. The Court found that although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(C) permits a bankruptcy court to enter final judgments on all counterclaims, Article III of the Constitution does not. The Court reiterated that Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution mandates the judicial power of the United States \"be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\" The judges for these courts must have constitutionally protected salaries and tenure. Bankruptcy judges do not enjoy these protections, and so, may not hear matters that must come before Article III courts. The Supreme Court applied the relevant case law to its analysis in Stern, including American Insurance Co., Murray's Lessee, Ex parte Bakelite Corp., Crowell, Thomas, Northern Pipeline Construction Co., Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Granfinanciera. Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the majority, relied heavily on Murray's Lessee and Northern Pipeline despite more recent precedent. The Court glossed over the most important issue for bankruptcy courts in a footnote of its decision: \"Because neither party asks us to reconsider the public rights framework for bankruptcy, we follow the same approach here . . . .\" By declining to discuss further the public rights framework for bankruptcy, the Court left bankruptcy judges and practitioners to rely on precedent that is not dispositive-some of it very shaky. This Comment proposes a seven-factor analysis to help guide bankruptcy judges and practitioners, and to help shed some light on how to determine whether a matter is a public right and so may be heard and decided by a bankruptcy court.",

Section 362(c)(3)(A) mandates that the automatic stay terminate, \u00bfwith respect to the debtor,\u00bf thirty days after the petition is filed if the debtor has had a prior case dismissed within one year of filing.

Insolvency raises the problems of any cross-border dispute: reciprocity, venue, choice of law, and cultural differences. However, unlike a typical adversarial dispute, successful insolvency proceedings do not have a single \"winner,\" and therefore raise unique problems. Insolvency's goal of maximum private and public economic benefit is best achieved through cooperation, efficiency, and overall asset maximization. Disparate parties each fighting for their best private outcome would contravene a harmonious proceeding to achieve this goal. However, the absence of a universal insolvency law makes achieving harmony through cooperation across borders especially difficult. Each country has its own laws and procedures, and each citizen creditor has expectations based on their respective sovereign's laws. Differences in these laws range from specific (such as priorities and dischargeable claims) to the overarching goals (such as creditor returns or job preservation).",

Originally, victims of a stay violation relied solely on the bankruptcy court's contempt power to recover damages. In 1984, Congress added a new subsection to \u00a7 362, now codified as \u00a7 362(k), to specifically authorize bankruptcy courts to award damages to an \"individual injured\" by a violation of the stay. Most importantly, \u00a7 362(k) permits bankruptcy courts to award punitive damages, which typically are not an available remedy for civil contempt.",

With \u00a7 362(k)(1), Congress made an express exception to allow debtors to recover attorneys' fees after a creditor willfully violates the automatic stay. For nearly twenty-five years, courts have interpreted \u00a7 362(k)(1) to allow debtors to recover attorneys' fees incurred by seeking damages against the automatic stay violator. However, in Sternberg v. Johnston, the Ninth Circuit created a split in authority when it refused to allow a debtor to recover the full extent of his attorneys' fees under \u00a7 362(k)(1).",

Timm, which refused to permit avoidance of the unsecured portion of a partially secured lien (\"strip down\"). The argument flows from a broader analysis of the proper characterization of secured claims in bankruptcy. Specifically, contrary to the state law ideation of \"secured\" that focuses on the identity of the claimant, the author urges that in bankruptcy the concept of \"secured\" should focus on that creditor's claim or claims as defined by the Bankruptcy Code. He argues not only that bankruptcy courts have the authority to develop a uniform federal rule in this area, but that to do so would limit Dewsnup to its narrowest possible construction, and perhaps provide the impetus for reexamination of a decision that is out-of-step with core bankruptcy policy and the Court's own bankruptcy jurisprudence.",

By extending the protection of the discharge exception of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(8) to private lenders, Congress effectively placed all students who take out loans to pay for their education at the mercy of a harsh system whose narrow exceptions for discharge force debtors to prove that they face a \"certainty of hopelessness\" in their future.",

On the rare occasions when courts and the National Labor Relations Board have addressed this issue, they have followed one of two approaches. The first approach limits debtors to imposing only labor terms found in their \"last, best offer\" to unions before filing a \u00a7 1113 motion. The second approach, however, permits debtors to impose any labor terms found in any pre-\u00a7 1113 proposals, subject to court approval.",

The Eleventh Circuit strictly interpreted 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 549 and 550 by holding that the trustee has the power to avoid such a transfer. This decision is problematic for two reasons. First, the innocent vendor had to forfeit the goods that it transferred and any cash collateral received in exchange. Second, the decision created an absurd result by preventing the innocent vendor from obtaining an administrative expense claim even though it conferred a benefit on the estate. This decision effectively prevents an innocent vendor from receiving any compensation for the sale of its goods.",

With the help and support of the Atlanta Bankruptcy Bar, EBDJ\u00bfs Advisory Board, and our sponsoring firms, the Eleventh Annual Symposium was a tremendous success. This year, the Symposium featured two panels. In the first, a Consumer Panel, panelists responded to Professor Lawrence Ponoroff\u00bfs article on chapter 7 lien-stripping, published in the Fall 2013 issue of EBDJ. 1 Lawrence Ponoroff, Hey the Sun Is Hot and the Water's Fine: Why Not Strip Off That Lien?, 30 Emory Bankr.

Our second panel focused on Corporate bankruptcy, and highlighted some of the current tensions in the chapter 11 process, given the large volume of petitions that end in a sale under 11 U.S.C \u00a7 363, rather than a chapter 11 plan confirmation. The following represents an edited transcript of the panels. EBDJ would like to thank its Advisory Board members, the panelists, and the moderators for their exceptional efforts on our behalf.

        "abstract": "To protect the interests of homeowners' associations and other housing communities in situations where their member homeowners have declared bankruptcy, \u00a7 523(a)(16) of the Bankruptcy Code excepts from discharge any \"fee or assessment\" that becomes due after the order of relief, as long as the debtor has a \"legal, equitable, or possessory ownership interest\" in the property. This section was intended to unify through legislation a split of authority deciding how to handle such postpetition fees. Unfortunately, by electing to protect first and foremost the interests of HOAs, Congress placed debtors in a position not conducive to the idea of a fresh start by which bankruptcy law is ordinarily guided. The result is a group of cases that are inconsistent with one another and with the Code, as some courts have taken steps to attempt to ease the burden on the debtor, while others have noted with resignation that, fair or not, the Code's plain language is clear and precludes judicial intervention. Further muddying the waters, the problems with the Code are different depending on whether the debtor's discharge was affected under \u00a7 727, \u00a7 1328(a), or \u00a7 1328(b). Given that the Code as written has failed to accomplish the unity sought in curing the split of authority, Congress should revisit not only its language but also the policy that informed the amendment. The nation's economic realities have changed since the 2005 amendment was passed, and these changes have brought into sharp focus the problems with the exception as it currently applies.",

        "abstract": "In two cases recently decided by the Ninth and Tenth Circuits, the courts independently considered whether a disgorgement order levied by securities regulators against a debtor is excepted from statutory discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(19) of the Code. The issue split the panels in both cases, producing vehement dissents. In both circuits, the majority held that \u00a7 523 does not except a debt arising from a disgorgement order from statutory discharge under \u00a7 727 if the debtor has not been charged with or convicted of violating state or federal securities laws. Thus, a debtor's obligation to disgorge funds acquired through the fraudulent activity of a third party is a dischargeable obligation in bankruptcy. This Comment argues that the decisions by the Ninth and Tenth Circuits incorrectly construed the plain meaning of \u00a7 523(a)(19) and ignored language in the statute that broadens the exception to embrace a debtor's obligation to disgorge funds acquired through the fraudulent misconduct of another individual. The Comment emphasizes that the character of the debt determined by the state courts should have been given preclusive effect by the bankruptcy courts. Deference to the state courts coincides with long-standing doctrines in bankruptcy law, which preserve in bankruptcy the property rights of the debtor defined by state or non-bankruptcy law. This new approach would aid the enforcement of security laws and support a framework for debtor attorneys and regulators preparing for litigation. Finally, lending preclusive effect to disgorgement orders does not threaten misappropriation of \u00a7 523 exceptions. Properly construed, \u00a7 523(a)(19) should except a debtor's obligation to return fraudulent funds regardless of their culpability for a security violation because there is a legitimate government interest in mitigating the egregious effect of large-scale investment fraud and protecting investors.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/ebdj/_documents/volumes/30/2/comments/boxold.pdf",
        "abstract": "Government payments received by a debtor postpetition are often tied to prepetition events, presenting the issue of whether a legal or equitable interest existed as of the commencement of the case under \u00a7 541 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have held that a debtor has no legal or equitable interest in a government payment until the legislation authorizing the payment is signed into law. These decisions, however, failed to articulate a clear standard, as evidenced by recent case law. The issue of when a government payment becomes property of the estate has been particularly contentious in the crop disaster payment context. A new program, the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Program (SURE), presents a novel fact pattern. In SURE, the Secretary of Agriculture must designate the county where a crop was lost as a disaster county before a farmer can qualify for payment. Therefore, when a bankruptcy petition is filed, payment may still be contingent upon an act within the agency\u00bfs discretion. This Comment will argue that a government payment becomes property of the estate when the payment is \u00bfabsolutely owed,\u00bf meaning the payment is no longer contingent in any way. First, the case law reveals no clear standard as to when a government payment becomes property of the estate under \u00a7 541. The right to setoff in \u00a7 553 has a clearer rule, a contrast that can help guide analysis. Second, recent cases regard the statutory authorization date as determinative, but this approach runs contrary to the Code and relevant case law, for \u00a7\u00a7 541 and 553 require a more nuanced factual inquiry. Third, administrative law dictates that a government payment becomes an entitlement for purposes of due process when legal sources create enforceable standards that guide an agency\u00bfs discretion. This standard should control when agency discretion is an issue.",

        "title": "Per Se Bad Faith? An Empirical Analysis of Good Faith in Chapter 13 Fee-Only Plans",
        "fulltext_url": "",
        "abstract": "Section 1325(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code requires chapter 13 plans to be \"proposed in good faith and not by any means prevented by law.\" Section 1325(a)(7) requires that \"the action of the debtor in filing the petition was in good faith.\" Courts evaluate both good faith provisions through a subjective inquiry into the totality of the circumstances in each case, typically using similar factors in the analysis. Many jurisdictions provide a list of factors for this assessment. Courts caution that any list is non-exhaustive and should not limit the subjective nature of the good faith inquiry. Some chapter 13 plans propose to pay little more than the trustee and attorney fees, and leave nothing or a nominal repayment to general unsecured creditors. These so-called \"fee-only\" plans challenge one of the underlying goals of chapter 13: a fair distribution of the debtor's future income to repay creditors. While courts find most fee-only plans fail to satisfy the good faith requirements, three circuit courts have ruled that fee-only plans are not per se bad faith. This Comment provides insight into how courts are actually dealing with fee-only cases through an empirical study of good faith litigation over plans proposing zero or a nominal repayment to general unsecured creditors. This study compiles data and conducts a broad analysis of the factors that courts have listed and discussed in the totality of the circumstances test for good faith. This Comment hypothesizes that two particular variables are significant predictors of a court's ruling on good faith: (1) the repayment to general unsecured creditors and (2) the number of factors discussed in the case. Analysis of the data does not support the first hypothesis but does support the second. This Comment concludes that, in the absence of a strong correlation between the number of factors and good faith rulings, courts should not overhaul the traditional good faith analysis when dealing with fee-only plans. This Comment suggests, however, one of the circuit court rulings may provide a modified approach that balances the benefits of a subjective, discretionary standard against the wide-ranging concern over plans that propose little or no repayment to general unsecured creditors.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/ebdj/_documents/volumes/30/2/comments/roth.pdf",
        "abstract": "Sunbeam Products, Inc. v. Chicago American Manufacturing, LLC incorrectly altered the remedies available to a trademark licensee after a debtor licensor has rejected the license. Decided in July 2012, this decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit conflicts with decisions going back more than twenty-five years, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit decided Lubrizol Enterprises, Inc. v. Richmond Metal Finishers, Inc. During that span of time, licensees had a single remedy upon rejection of the license: damages in the way of an unsecured prepetition claim. Licensees were not granted specific performance, and were not permitted to continue using the trademark or retain any other rights under the license, save for the claim for damages. Congress had granted guaranteed specific performance to the licensee of a patent, copyright, or trade secret through 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(n). However, when Congress enacted \u00a7 365(n) in 1989, Congress explicitly and unequivocally excluded trademark licenses from the protection of that provision. In July 2012, the Seventh Circuit held in Sunbeam that because trademark licensees are not protected by \u00a7 365(n), the Bankruptcy Code is silent as to the rejection of a trademark license. A licensee was granted the right to continued use of the trademark, just as that remedy would be available outside of bankruptcy. Ideal as this holding may be, this Comment argues it is contradictory to a careful examination and interpretation of the law as it applies, and historically has been applied. Fundamentally, allowing a trademark licensee to retain its rights is a de facto order of specific performance on a trademark owner, but when that owner is a debtor in bankruptcy, specific performance should not be available against it. In short, Sunbeam should not be given any weight going forward. A licensee should be limited to a prepetition claim for damages, only.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/ebdj/_documents/volumes/30/2/comments/velten.pdf",
        "abstract": "U.S. Courts of Appeals disagree on the correct interpretation of the phrase \"statement respecting the debtor's . . . financial condition\" as it appears in the exceptions to discharge in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A), the fraud provision, and \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B), the false written statement provision. Two major viewpoints have emerged-the strict and the relaxed. Under the strict interpretation, for the fraud provisions to apply, the statement must comprise the overall financial condition of the debtor. According to the relaxed interpretation, the debtor's fraudulent assertion of ownership of only a single item of property constitutes a statement respecting the debtor's financial condition. The Fifth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits have adopted the strict interpretation, while the Fourth Circuit has followed the relaxed interpretation since 1984. Lower courts in other circuits have gone both ways. The divergence of opinion has resulted in some courts allowing debtors who acquired money through fraud or misrepresentation to walk away from those debts by discharging them in bankruptcy, while others hold such debtors accountable and refuse discharge. This Comment interprets \u00a7 523(a)(2) and concludes that the correct reading of \"financial condition\" is the debtor's overall financial health-the view of the courts that have adopted the strict interpretation. This Comment further proposes adding a definition of \"financial condition\" to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 to resolve the circuit split. This split jeopardizes the dual purposes of bankruptcy-to provide relief to honest debtors and to ensure the fair treatment of creditors. As it is, in some jurisdictions debtors who commit fraud are allowed to abandon their debts, leaving creditors in a lurch. Burning creditors in this way may result in negative repercussions for other debtors, such as decreased borrowing ability. Providing a clear definition of \"financial condition\" will help promote better bankruptcy policy for debtors and creditors.",

The question of how social media should be characterized leaves bankruptcy courts uncertain as to whether social media accounts should be included in the bankruptcy estate. While social media encompasses aspects of property, intellectual property, and other rights, this Comment argues that social media does not fit solely into any of these categories.

        "abstract": "Casey Anthony, charged with first-degree murder of her two-year-old daughter, filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2013. Absent from Ms. Anthony\u00bfs list of assets are intellectual property rights in a book that she has stated she will write based on her life-story. This Comment addresses whether a life-story and future book rights should be property of the bankruptcy estate. It relies on legal arguments based on 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a), copyright law, labor theory, and the right of publicity. Practical arguments based on real-world practice and public policy, such as the entry of intellectual property into the public domain and Son of Sam statutes, are also considered. After determining that Ms. Anthony\u00bfs life-story and future book rights should be considered property of the bankruptcy estate, this Comment also argues that a market-based approach to valuation is the appropriate method to be used for assessing the value of intellectual property rights of this sort.",

        "abstract": "In BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp., the Supreme Court held that the consideration received at a foreclosure sale is, in itself, reasonably equivalent value and rejected a minimum threshold amount. In its attempt to clarify the law, the Court left open the option for a bankruptcy trustee to avoid a foreclosure sale based on a lack of state law compliance. First, this Comment compares the decision in BFP and its predecessors with the legislative intent behind the various fraudulent transfer acts and \u00a7 548 of the Bankruptcy Code. Second, this Comment further proposes amending the Bankruptcy Code to require a trustee seeking avoidance of a real estate transfer to show a lack of substantial compliance with state real estate foreclosure laws and to expressly exempt foreclosure sales from \u00a7 548\u00bfs reasonably equivalent value requirement. Finally, this Comment proposes needed definitions in \u00a7 101 of the Bankruptcy Code including definitions for \u00bfreasonably equivalent value\u00bf and \u00bfreal estate foreclosure sale.\u00bf",

An early discharge permits such a debtor to receive a discharge before making all payments under the confirmed plan. The Article analyzes the circumstances that warrant issuing such an early discharge, and what information ought to be included in the disclosure statement, plan, and notice of confirmation hearing. The Article concludes that an individual chapter 11 debtor may obtain a early discharge: (1) upon confirmation of a reorganization plan where the debtor has paid unsecured creditors before confirmation, or where necessary to keep important customers or to obtain financing to pay unsecured creditors, or (2) after plan confirmation but before plan payments are finished if the unsecured creditors have received the required distribution and the debtor no longer has sufficient income to meet living expenses and to make the required payments.",

The Safe Harbors seek to accomplish this goal by permitting a party to a derivative trading contract to quickly terminate and liquidate its positions. The precise parameters of the Safe Harbors remain unclear. This lack of clarity adversely affects the ability of market participants to accurately perform credit risk analyses with respect to their derivative trading counterparties and may adversely impact the ability of market participants to prepare Living Wills, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Similarly, it adversely affects the ability of a party to reorganize under the Bankruptcy Code.

Rather, their claims arise because the debtor has harmed them without their consent. While courts have the authority to form creditors\u00bf committees for tort claimants, courts do not uniformly grant tort claimants\u00bf requests. This Comment argues that courts should form creditors\u00bf committees for tort claimants when corporate debtors with tort liability file for bankruptcy. First, there are strong policy reasons for forming creditors\u00bf committees for tort claimants. Second, courts need to form creditors\u00bf committees for tort claimants to ensure that tort claimants are guaranteed due process of the law. Third, forming creditors\u00bf committees for tort claimants is consistent with the case law interpreting 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1102(a)(2).

However, judicial estoppel produces an inequitable result where the plaintiff-debtor omitted a lawsuit from the bankruptcy case because of a mistake. In that case, the alleged wrongdoer prevails regardless of the strength of the plaintiff\u00bfs claim or the plaintiff\u00bfs culpability excluding the potential or pending lawsuit from the bankruptcy filings. This Comment argues that using a subjective inquiry to determine when to invoke judicial estoppel better serves the objectives of bankruptcy law and maintains the integrity of the judicial process. This subjective inquiry focuses on five factors to determine whether the debtor\u00bfs omission was the result of inadvertence or mistake.",

Often, third parties enter into guarantee agreements unaware of the detrimental effect bankruptcy filing has on their rights.

Filing for bankruptcy may increase risk to the guarantor beyond what he or she anticipated at the time of personally guaranteeing the debt.

State courts have generally followed the Court\u00bfs jurisprudence in interpreting the contract clauses of their own constitution.

This Comment argues that state courts should abandon this jurisprudence and adopt a much stricter interpretation of their own clause that is more in line with the Court\u00bfs earlier decisions.

Because the Code affords greater protections to currencies than to commodities, bitcoin\u00bfs classification has far-reaching implications in the context of bankruptcy; however, no bankruptcy court has yet affirmatively ruled on bitcoin\u00bfs treatment. This Comment first explores what bitcoins are and the respective arguments for each classification in the currency versus commodity debate. Then, this Comment examines the current legal treatment of bitcoin and bitcoin-specific issues in bankruptcy. Finally, this Comment argues that bitcoin must be affirmatively classified and proposes a licensing solution to bitcoin's classification; and then explores the effects this solution would have in bankruptcy.",

        "abstract": "While unfinished business claims have played a role in nearly every major law firm bankruptcy in the past ten years, the law remains unsettled. As major law firm bankruptcies become more prevalent, scholarly debate has centered on whether pending hourly fee arrangements should be included in a law firm\u00bfs bankruptcy estate. This Comment will advocate for the abolishment of unfinished business claims in the bankruptcy setting because these claims yield unworkable results under Sections 541, 363, and 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Alternatively, this Comment will argue that including unfinished business in a law firm\u00bfs bankruptcy estate violates public policy by interfering with a client\u00bfs right to counsel. Finally, this Comment will provide practical guidance for firms wishing to contract around unfinished business claims.",

        "abstract": "Although, the topic of firearms is often controversial and political, gun owners in the U.S. predominantly own firearms in a way that arguably allow firearms to be classified as \u00bfhousehold goods\u00bf in Section 522(f)(1)(b) and be included in the list of items that fit within the term of \u00bfhousehold goods\u00bf in Section 522(f)(4)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. The recent proposals of the Protecting Gun Owners in Bankruptcy Acts of 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2015 make this a timely issue that should be addressed. The proposals of the Protecting Gun Owners in Bankruptcy Acts have requested that firearms be classified as \u00bfhousehold goods\u00bf in Section 522(f)(4)(A).

        "abstract": "Unlike the vast majority of consumer debts owed to private lenders, educational loans made by private lending institutions are protected as non-dischargeable under Section 523(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code. Because most borrowers cannot shirk their obligations to private student lenders, even by filing for bankruptcy, lenders are willing to lend more in this context than with other dischargeable forms of debt; thus artificially inflating the market for higher education loans. This practice is becoming crucial to the health of our overall economy as student loans have become one of the largest forms of consumer debt in the United States, second only to mortgages. This Comment examines why private student lenders should not be afforded special protection under Section 523(a)(8), and then suggests that removing this protection and thus allowing the discharge of private student loans can help to deflate the growing higher education bubble.",

Currently, a majority of courts require trustees to file any settlements they enter into with creditors with the court where the bankruptcy case is pending.

Requiring judicial approval of settlement agreements is consistent with the underlying policy of the Bankruptcy Code, legislative history, common law practice, and pre-Bankruptcy Code practice. This requirement would also promote uniformity among federal procedure rules. Accordingly, this Comment recommends that the Advisory Committee on Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure amend Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019 to require judicial approval of settlement agreements.",

The removal of the part of a lien that is partially unsecured is called a \u00bfstrip down,\u00bf whereas the removal of a completely unsecured lien is called a \u00bfstrip off.\u00bf The Supreme Court has held that a \u00bfstrip down\u00bf in both a chapter 7 and a chapter 13 are impermissible modifications of a secured claim. Recently, the Supreme Court held in Bank of America, N.A. v. Caulkett that a strip off in chapter 7 is also impermissible.

Although zombie foreclosures present a significant issue for individuals who filed for bankruptcy during the last few years, there is no satisfactory legal remedy.

Due to flexibility within bankruptcy courts, bankruptcy judges have a greater degree of discretion within certain situations to fulfill their equitable powers. Bankruptcy judges can take the realities of the debtor\u00bfs circumstances into account in ways that state and federal courts cannot.

This Comment argues that those harmed by General Motors\u00bf defective vehicles should have access to an equitable remedy via the successor liability doctrine.

In upholding the constitutionality of non-Article III bankruptcy adjudications with litigant consent, Wellness resolved an important issue raised by the Court\u00bfs momentous 2011 Stern v. Marshall decision. The Wellness opinion, though, has more profound implications for the constitutionality of non-Article III adjudications, both bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy, whether those non-Article III adjudications are conducted with or without litigant consent. Beyond the bankruptcy context, Wellness reveals a general Supreme Court jurisprudence with a bifurcated analytical methodology that facilitates a complex interaction between the waivable personal and non-waivable structural interests protected by Article III, \u00a7 1. In the bankruptcy context, Wellness provides further evidence that the Court is, over a long run of decisions, simply confirming the constitutional significance of its extensive summary-plenary jurisprudence as the operative constitutional constraint on the adjudicatory powers of non-Article III bankruptcy judges.",

        "abstract": "Cramdown is the confirmation of a plan of reorganization over the dissent of an entire class of creditors. Bankruptcy\u00bfs absolute priority rule permits such confirmation only if the dissenting class is paid in full, or if no junior class receives anything. \u00bfPaid in full,\u00bf however, does not require payment in cash. It can consist of intangible promises to pay money that banks, investors, and markets regularly value. Whether this market value can precisely be transferred to cramdown has vexed many. Recently, the debate has flared when a bankruptcy court applied a chapter 13 case, Till v. SCS Credit Corp., to cramdown confirmation in Momentive, a large chapter 11 case. Given the legislative history and precedents in the cramdown area, this Article takes the position that Momentive was correct, and that courts should resist using pure market-based valuations in cramdown calculations.",

The Article argues that the controversy stems from courts and scholars assigning undue importance to preserving creditors\u00bf nonbankruptcy endowments in a manner that is inconsistent with foundational bankruptcy policy. The Article makes the case that the guiding principle for optimal bankruptcy design should instead be the minimization of opportunistic behavior that reduces the net value of a firm. Applying this principle to the question of the cramdown interest rate, this piece shows that an optimal rule supports a cramdown interest rate based on the prevailing market rates for similar loans. The Article demonstrates that this approach is consistent with the Bankruptcy Code and the theoretical principles (although not the ultimate conclusion) that Professor Markell has advocated.",

        "abstract": "Equitable mootness has troubled appellate courts since its creation in the 1980s. Despite the doctrine\u00bfs express limitation to \u00bfcomplex reorganizations,\u00bf courts have found appeals from relatively simple reorganizations and liquidation plans equitably moot. Courts have criticized and limited the doctrine in recent years, resulting in three Court of Appeals decisions within ten weeks of each other in 2015. This Comment argues that these criticisms ultimately stemmed from the doctrine\u00bfs misapplication. To apply the equitable mootness properly, this Comment proposes that appellate courts should first determine whether a complex reorganization occurred as a threshold matter. This Comment offers a four-factor normative approach to \u00bfcomplexity\u00bf that would determine whether a complex reorganization occurred. If a court determines a complex reorganization occurred after assessing these four factors, only then should it proceed to an equitable mootness analysis. This approach will keep equitable mootness the exception, not the rule.",

Under the new definition, a document is a return if the document \u00bfsatisfies the requirements of applicable bankruptcy law (including applicable filing requirements).\u00bf Following the amendments, the Fifth Circuit created the \u00bfone-day-late\u00bf rule when it held that a tax form filed one day late is never a valid tax return.

        "abstract": "Although the Bankruptcy Code and the FDCPA have different purposes, the two frequently overlap where debt collectors are concerned. For example, consider a debt collector who sends a perfunctory initial collection letter referencing a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy. Even though this letter technically violates the debtor\u00bfs fresh start and is unfair and deceptive, the remedies under both statutes require knowledge of the discharge, which the debt collector likely did not have, and which the FDCPA does not impute from the original creditor. This Comment suggests that the problem is a lack of information. This Comment proposes a solution that provides accurate information of discharged debts while also protecting the fresh start: amending the FDCPA to (1) create a national registry to house discharge orders; and (2) require that debt collectors search the registry prior to making a first collection attempt.",

        "abstract": "Five circuit courts have determined whether an employer\u00bfs unpaid contributions due under an employee benefit plan are plan assets under ERISA. When unpaid contributions are plan assets, the individual exercising authority or control over the assets is imputed fiduciary status under ERISA and, in turn, owes certain fiduciary duties and obligations to employee benefit funds. If the fiduciary fails to make the required contributions, then that individual becomes personally liable for the unpaid contributions. In bankruptcy, this result means that the unpaid contributions would be a nondischargeable debt if the court holds the individual liable for defalcation. This Comment reconciles the circuit split between the courts that decided this issue in bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy proceedings. It proposes a three-step approach that will allow courts determining this issue in bankruptcy proceedings to mirror their counterparts while still preserving the spirit of the Bankruptcy Code.",

In In re Jevic, however, the Third Circuit closed the case by utilizing a fourth option: a structured dismissal, a type of relief not explicitly provided for in the Bankruptcy Code. Notably, the court confirmed the dismissal even though its provisions violated the Code\u00bfs priority scheme. This Comment argues that structured dismissals are permissible under the Code, but they cannot deviate from the priority scheme.",

The ultimate solution to financial distress is relief under the Bankruptcy Code. Private entities are eligible for relief under chapter 11, but municipalities are eligible for relief under chapter 9. Chapter 9 affords municipalities significant protections compared to private entities under chapter 11. Nonetheless, even though common interest communities also provide public goods, they are eligible for relief only under chapter 11 and thus lack the protections afforded by chapter 9. Chapter 11 of the Code should be amended in two ways to afford common interest communities some of the benefits of chapter 9. Without these amendments, common interest communities in financial distress and their members will be less likely to reorganize, and the cost of providing public goods will revert to the local community and its taxpayers.",

The sale of consumer information causes problems for consumers because many bankruptcy retailers transfer personally identifiable information to third parties without notifying consumers beforehand and obtaining their consent. Perhaps most troubling, however, is that retailers facing financial turmoil sometimes sell personally identifiable information in direct violation of their own privacy policies, which specifically promise the safeguarding of consumer information. Numerous regulatory bodies have objected to such transfers, but to no avail. This Comment addresses the shortcomings of current privacy regulations both inside and outside of bankruptcy. Additionally, this Comment recommends the implementation of minimum federal privacy standards and suggests that the Bankruptcy Code include stronger consumer privacy guidelines. These approaches would allow consumers to have a say in who receives their personally identifiable information while simultaneously preserving the status quo.",

        "abstract": "This excellent Article by business school professors Sandeep Dahiya and Korok Ray provides a mathematical framework as an analytical tool to assist bankruptcy judges when confronting a Debtor-in-Possession financing situation. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code provides enhanced priority and security features to debtor-in-possession (DIP) loans which can be obtained from a lender with whom the borrower may have no past lending relationship. The enhanced priority of DIP financing, and the choice of a DIP lender, significantly affect the investment decisions made by the firm. This Article shows that DIP loans from an existing lender leads to a higher level of investment. The authors also show that a higher priority of DIP financing also leads to higher investment by the firm. A bankruptcy judge should take these incentives into account when approving the DIP loan. The authors conclude with extensive mathematical models to assist judges and firms in evaluating DIP loan decisions.",

Debtors seeking to save their homes usually rely on Code \u00a7 1322(b)(5) which provides that a debtor may \u00bfcure\u00bf a default. Many mortgage lenders object to debtors\u00bf plans proposing to cure the mortgage default on the grounds that the plan is modification of their rights, forbidden by \u00a7 1322(b)(2). Circuit courts have regularly allowed debtors to cure a default without running afoul of this anti-modification provision. The Fourth Circuit has abruptly turned course by disallowing such a cure. As a remedy, the author proposes an amendment to the Code to include a provision that defines a cure as a debtor\u00bfs ability to nullify the consequences of default and restore the debtor to his pre-default conditions.",

        "abstract": "Despite the importance of the automatic stay, in healthcare bankruptcies it is not always applied consistently, especially when the government is the creditor. Government agencies decide whether they will require the bankrupt healthcare provider to repay any Medicare overpayments previously paid. As such, government agencies may jump other creditors based on the equitable doctrine of recoupment. Recoupment is a doctrine recognized by bankruptcy courts allowing for creditors to offset their debts against payments. This is similar to setoff, an action that is not permitted under the Code. The author argues that government agencies should not be allowed to continue recoupment actions against healthcare entities that will jeopardize their reorganization processes. The author suggests that courts can fix this issue by narrowly applying the doctrine of recoupment and reducing the circumstances in which government agencies can collect from bankrupt healthcare entities without seeking relief from the automatic stay.",

        "abstract": "Courts often apply the Burford abstention doctrine in cases involving a state insurance insolvency proceeding. This tendency for federal courts to remand cases in deference to state proceedings in the insurance insolvency context derives from a Congressional policy of allowing states to regulate the insurance industry under the McCarran-Ferguson Act and the exclusion of insurance companies from the Bankruptcy Code. The author examines the processes used by different courts to determine whether to invoke Burford abstention and proposes the adoption of a formula that builds upon a set of factors developed by the Tenth Circuit to address additional concerns. The proposed formula draws from case law and the policy goals underlying Burford abstention while emphasizing the role of avoiding the disruption of a state\u00bfs efforts to establish insolvency proceedings for insurance companies. Through a six-part test, Courts can properly navigate the application of the \u00bftroublesome and enigmatic\u00bf Burford abstention doctrine.",

        "abstract": "Long-standing regulations mandate that coal companies post bonds for land restoration after mining operations are complete. However, coal companies can use financial liquidity to satisfy these bonds, known as self-bonding. Companies are using the fiscal strength of subsidiaries instead of their own accounts to self-bond. Ultimately, a company can appear financially healthy enough to qualify for reclamation bonds, but in the face of a declining industry it may not have enough cash to cover full clean-up of mining sites. Bankruptcy highlights the insufficiency of such reclamation procedures and the supporting bonding process. The author evaluates several ways to cope with the self-bonding problem under the existing bankruptcy framework, including the existing requirements of the good faith and feasibility requirements, and proposes a carved out exception within the Bankruptcy Code disallowing prior coal bankruptcy debtors from self-bonding.",

        "abstract": "In most situations, the Bankruptcy Code prohibits insiders of businesses from seeking preferential treatment from a bankrupt debtor. One way the Code does this is through excluding an insider\u00bfs vote from the plan approval process in a chapter 11 bankruptcy cramdown. But, if an insider can find a way to escape the narrow statutory insider definition in the Code, then the usual prohibitions on insider conduct may not apply. In addition to the narrow, specified list of statutory insiders in the Code, courts have crafted various definitions of non-statutory insiders as well. This lack of uniform and predictable application has thwarted one of bankruptcy\u00bfs main goals: the equitable treatment of creditors. The author examines courts\u00bf conflicting applications of insider rules, with a focus on chapter 11, and recommends a change to how insiders are defined in the Code to prevent inequitable outcomes for creditors.",

The author argues that the Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession model causes major corporate governance problems due to management incentives that do not align with creditor interests. The bankruptcy court has, however, a strong instrument to detect and undo wrongdoing: the appointment of examiners. To overcome the expense and complication associated with traditional examiners, the author proposes the appointment of preliminary examiners. These examiners would conduct a summary investigation to detect potential violations of the law and report their findings to the bankruptcy court. On that basis, the court could make a more informed decision on the initial question of whether to appoint an ordinary examiner and, further, on the scope of her mandate. The main advantage compared to traditional examiners would be the substantially lower costs. This reform proposal would not only help to enrich the estate in the individual case but would also deter wrongdoing in the future. It hence can be understood as a tool to improve corporate governance in financially distressed or bankrupt companies.",

Congress created bankruptcy courts to help efficiently and effectively facilitate this goal. However, the complexity of debtor-creditor relationships necessitates that most bankruptcy proceedings hear a variety of claims, some of which may not arise out of the bankruptcy itself but are still required for bankruptcy resolution. Consequently, the authority of bankruptcy courts to hear all relevant claims is an essential component of bankruptcy relief. Bankruptcy Courts are not granted authority under Article III of the Constitution, but under Article I.

Courts use judicial recharacterization as a mechanism to reorder the priority of payments if the judge believes that the true nature of the transaction has the characteristics of an equity relationship from the outset, despite being classified as a loan. Recent debate has centered around the unwieldy and unpredictable nature of these recharacterizations. Creditors often face dramatic differences in the outcome of litigation depending on the jurisdiction in which their claim arises. Courts facing questions of judicial recharacterization have analyzed these aspects in dramatically different ways creating a split among the circuit courts on all three aspects.

        "abstract": "Section 505 of the Bankruptcy Code allows a court of determine tax related issues. Apart from three narrow exceptions contained within the provision, bankruptcy courts\u00bf authority under \u00a7 505 is essentially limitless. The broad language of \u00a7 505 extends bankruptcy courts\u00bf authority far beyond the context of bankruptcy, and courts have acknowledged that the plain meaning of the statute effectively creates a second tax court system. Interpreting \u00a7 505 in this manner raises constitutionality and federalism concerns and is ostensibly impractical. For these reasons, courts have taken three general approaches to define the extent of bankruptcy courts\u00bf authority under \u00a7 505. This Comment evaluates these three approaches and examines other limitations and mechanisms that courts have utilized to restrict bankruptcy courts\u00bf authority to adjudicate \u00a7 505 proceedings. It concludes that the \u00bfarising under\u00bf approach is the ideal solution to \u00a7 505 because it emphasizes practicality while adhering to statutory canons and the goals of bankruptcy.",

        "abstract": "In corporate bankruptcies, regulations encourage the de-identification of consumer information and the restriction of sales to a limited pool of qualified purchasers operating in a similar industry. Judicial discretion is used to transfer privity from a debtor to a qualified purchaser. Both de-identification and the qualified purchaser requirement reduce consumer data values in bankruptcy and provide only a thin veil of protection. This Comment argues that courts should use their discretion to alter not only the privity among parties but also the terms of purchase in bankruptcy to maximize the value of consumer data claims.",

        "abstract": "Claims trading, the buying and selling of creditor claims, is a common part of modern bankruptcy. Most scholars denounce claims trading as a disruptor in the bankruptcy process. What the current research fails to recognize is that confining the analysis on claims trading to the single greatest-frequency period leads to incomplete theories. In reality, claims trading takes place outside of this period as well. When reexamined outside of the mainstream\u00bfs contexts (i.e., prior to the petition date or after plan confirmation), claims trading can offer significant benefits. Trading at these periods fosters healthier bargaining between the debtor and its creditors and enhances the likelihood of a swift procedure. Thus, bankruptcy constituents should contemplate and, moreover, endorse claims trading at either the pre-petition or post-plan confirmation phases so as to ease concerns about a trade\u00bfs disruptive capacity inside a bankruptcy case.",

From this study, the Article concludes that bankruptcy courts find few core proceeding that they decide are covered by Stern and thus are beyond the bankruptcy court\u00bfs constitutional power to decide.

While no court has awarded collaterally harmed third parties damages arising from an involuntary bankruptcy, the Third Circuit has recently open the door for some form of non-debtor recovery. In 2016, the Third Circuit declared that non-debtor third parties could seek a recovery for damages arising from an involuntary petition in state court.

        "abstract": "When it decided Matter of Spanish Peaks Holdings II, LLC, the Ninth Circuit exposed a major loophole in the Bankruptcy Code relating to landlords and tenants. This loophole may be exploited by shrewd real estate developers who create two corporate entities and place each into a landlord-tenant relationship, with the lease\u00bfs terms heavily favoring the tenant corporate entity. Creating this artificial landlord-tenant relationship would permit the tenant entity to retain possession of the property should the landlord entity ever have to file for bankruptcy. This would permit the developer to receive a financial windfall either in the form of a buyout of the tenant entity\u00bfs lease by a third-party purchaser, or by the continued operation of the tenant entity\u00bfs business on the purchaser\u00bfs land. The author analyzes the majority and minority approaches to this loophole, and ultimately argues that the minority approach is more pragmatic.

As chapter 9 municipal bankruptcies have become more numerous, debtors have sought third-party relief there as well. The author categorizes these chapter 9 cases into two categories. The first involves cases where the State provides funds to the reorganization effort in exchange for some creditors giving up claims against the State. The second consists of cases where a city attempts to relieve its police officers of liability for civil rights violations by including injunctions against the civil rights plaintiffs in the city\u00bfs plan of reorganization. The author argues that the second category of cases have ignored fundamental limitations on third-party relief and allow debtors to exploit a test that was not intended for chapter 9 bankruptcy. This leads the author to propose replacing the \u00bfnecessity\u00bf standard with one suited for municipal bankruptcies.",

        "abstract": "This outstanding Article by Professor Laura N. Coordes discusses the difficulty tribal debtors experience when dealing with financial distress. This Article reveals how and why the Bankruptcy Code is a poor fit for tribal debtors. Instead, this Article proposes that Congress enact a new statutory regime to provide structured debt relief for tribal entities. This Article analyzes analogous situations in which Congress looked beyond the Bankruptcy Code to provide debt relief when the Bankruptcy Code was unable to do so.",

Universally, courts may address committee misbehavior through the disallowance of the committee\u00bfs attorneys\u00bf fees, or through a modification of the committee\u00bfs membership. Where these remedies are inadequate, a split has emerged amongst the courts as to whether bankruptcy judges have the authority to use the \u00bfjudicial hammer\u00bf of disbanding a misbehaving committee. Looking to the history of chapter 11 committees and present-day examples of committee misbehavior, the author argues that when a committee is engaged in severe misfeasance or malfeasance, bankruptcy judges must have the power to disband the committee.",

The author argues that this strategy is misguided, as the university is not the recipient of a fraudulent transfer, but rather, the student is the recipient. This leads the author to conclude that the university was involved in a good faith transfer for value, and thus it should be immune from liability to the bankruptcy trustee or the estate. Of course, this would mean that the student was the recipient of a fraudulent transfer, and thus liable to the trustee for this nondischargeable debt.",

        "abstract": "The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-border Insolvency was conceived in 1997 with the objective of facilitating the optimal management of cross-border insolvency. Its aim was to do so by providing an adoptable, consistent framework for countries to recognize foreign insolvency proceedings. While the Model Law has achieved some success in promoting cooperation among the different Asian-Pacific states in cross-border insolvency proceedings, the goals of the model law have still yet to be realized to their fullest extent. This is likely the result of states neglecting to fully implement the model law into their respective domestic laws and state judiciaries inconsistently interpreting what legislation they have implemented to enact the model law. This informative Article by Wai Yee Wan and Gerard McCormack examines the different strategies Asia-Pacific states have taken to implement the model law and assesses the reasons for the divergence among the different states. This Article illustrates the complexities and limitations of achieving the objectives of a model law when the path dependency matters and sets each state on a unique course.",

The author focuses on the majority and dissenting opinions in Indian Harbor Insurance Company v.

The author draws inspiration and builds on the work of Chrystin Ondersma and tells the story of a hypothetical undocumented debtor, \u201cChristina,\u201d to ultimately make the argument that the debtor\u2019s use of a false social security number for employment purposes does not meet the elements needed for bankruptcy fraud.

        "abstract": "Bulk sale statutes require purchasers in a bulk sale to follow certain procedures in order to protect the state\u2019s interest in recovering and collecting unpaid taxes. The recent decision in Illinois Department of Revenue v. Hanmi Bank left many practitioners wanting for a more robust answer to the questions of whether bulk sale provisions create interests of value for state revenue departments and how courts should classify those interests. The author argues that these interests should be protectable under \u00a7 363(e) of the Bankruptcy Code. The author further provides a framework for courts to determine the extent to which this protection should extend. Under this framework, which builds on statements made in dicta in Illinois Department of Revenue v. Hanmi Bank, the burden should be placed on a state\u2019s department of revenue to prove that failing to protect an interest derived from the bulk sale statute will result in that interest losing value. A state would successfully prove this by showing that it would have recovered value from its interest had that interest been protected.",

This Comment addresses how the TCJA has highlighted an existing tension between the Bankruptcy and Tax Codes concerning whether S corporation shareholder termination rights granted under \u00a7 1362 of the Tax Code should constitute avoidable fraudulent transfers under \u00a7 548 of the Bankruptcy Code. Traditionally, courts have permitted bankruptcy trustees to unilaterally shift capital gains liabilities incurred from asset liquidation sales of insolvent S corporations to the businesses\u2019 shareholders and characterize such terminations as fraudulent transfers. However, recent decisions in the Third and Fourth Circuits have restricted the trustee\u2019s \u201cStrong Arm\u201d power to avoid S election terminations. The author considers this tension between the two codes as well as the TCJA\u2019s implications on S corporation shareholders. It then finally makes a suggestion for creating an exception to the fraudulent transfer conveyance doctrine for S corporations.",
