      "abstract": "Society is rightly outraged to see America\u00bfs dark history of slavery repeat itself in the form of human trafficking. However, society should be equally concerned about the new face of those who support human trafficking: components of mainstream corporate America. A review of the relevant history of antebellum slavery reveals that one reason why antebellum slavery continued as long as it did was because of the support it received from economic interests that benefited directly and indirectly from the exploitation. Sadly, that reality is once again apparent today as human trafficking thrives in the world in part because it is profitable to the traffickers and others. It is so profitable that legitimate businesses that benefit from it\u00bfor from the structures that allow it to thrive\u00bfare willing to tolerate it and actively thwart efforts to end human trafficking. This Essay examines these historical parallels and advocates that human trafficking cannot be defeated until such entities are willing to place human beings above profits.",

      "abstract": "The United States Supreme Court recently ruled in Packingham v. North Carolina that the state\u00bfs law banning registered sex offenders from using social networking sites was unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds. An issue that has arisen in the case is the state\u00bfs justification for the ban. North Carolina and thirteen other states represented in a friend of the court brief make three claims concerning the risk of registered sex offenders: (1) sex offenders have a notoriously high rate of sexual recidivism; (2) sex offenders are typically crossover offenders in having both adult and child victims; and (3) sexual predators commonly use social networking sites to lure children for sexual exploitation purposes. The collective states contend that these three claims are supported by scientific evidence and common sense. This Essay outlines how the states misconstrue, and at times misrepresent, the scientific evidence they cite regarding such risk-based claims.",

      "abstract": "A number of white supremacist groups enjoy tax-exempt status. These hate groups do not have to pay federal taxes and people who give money to these groups may take deductions on their personal taxes. This recognition not only results in potential lost revenue for government programs, but it also serves as a public subsidy of racist propaganda and operates as the federal government\u00bfs imprimatur of white supremacist activities. This is all due to an unnecessarily broad definition of \u00bfeducational\u00bf that somehow encompasses the activities of universities, symphonies, and white supremacists. This Essay suggests a change in the Treasury Regulations to restrict the definition of educational organizations to refer only to traditional, degree-granting institutions, distance-learning organizations, or certain other enumerated entities. With this change, we would no longer allow white supremacists to call themselves charities, remove the public subsidy of such reprehensible organizations, and eliminate the government\u00bfs implicit blessing of hate groups.",

      "abstract": "Senators vigorously dispute the Thurmond Rule\u00bfs meaning in the 2016 presidential election year. The Rule is a peculiar tradition. The party not controlling the White House systematically invokes the custom during presidential election years to halt judicial designees\u00bf consideration until November with the hope that its standard bearer prevails and, thus, can appoint jurists. This year, Senators Grassley and McConnell characterized the tenet as \u00bfflexible,\u00bf while Grassley declared that nominee confirmations generally end at the summer recess. Because confusion plagues definition of the stricture, and the Rule\u00bfs incessant use dramatically exacerbates the vacancy crisis, its perpetuation merits scrutiny.

The chamber needs to abolish the Rule, or at least codify and confine the approach within the Senate rules until a clear majority who favors abrogation emerges.",

Congress fails because this delegation allows legislators to shift blame to the agency for harms that statutes do to their constituents.

Across five years in Barack Obama\u00bfs presidency, the judiciary confronted some eighty-five vacancies because Republicans never agreed to prompt Senate consideration. Over 2015, the GOP cooperated little, approving the fewest jurists since Dwight Eisenhower was President. However, selection might worsen. This year is a presidential election year, a period in which confirmations traditionally slow to a halt, and a predicament that controversy regarding Justice Antonin Scalia\u00bfs High Court vacancy exacerbates. At the next inauguration, the bench may experience 100 unfilled circuit and trial level positions. These concerns demonstrate that the broken appointments system requires permanent improvement. This survey evaluates confirmations during President Obama\u00bfs tenure, detecting that Republicans have plumbed new depths for obstruction. Because this recalcitrance undermines judicial selection, the delivery of justice and respect for the coequal branches of government, the analysis proffers multiple long-term solutions, notably a bipartisan judiciary, which could enhance the process.",

      "abstract": "In his article Excessive Corporate Risk-Taking and the Decline of Personal Blame, Professor Schwarcz succinctly identifies the shortcomings of the existing regulatory infrastructure in the context of risk-taking, and he evaluates the adequacy of firm-level liability. While Professor Schwarcz\u00bfs main points are of course well taken, and he certainly makes a tremendous contribution to the literature on excessive risk-taking by executives, a key assumption underlying most of the proposals Professor Schwarcz analyzes is that rules could and should be optimally tailored to address a perceived regulatory problem. In an environment of exponentially increasing disruptive innovation, such assumptions may not be justified. In fact, the assumption that stable and optimal rules are a necessary and adequate remedy in many ways supports and perpetuates excessive risk-taking by executives, financial crises, and financial regulatory cycles. A key role for scholarship in this context could be the evaluation of supplemental governance mechanisms that help the main regulatory framework adapt to constantly changing market environments, disruptive (financial) innovation, and the regulatory environment.",

      "abstract": "Thomas Piketty\u00bfs Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which is surely one of the very few economics treatises ever to be a best-seller, has parachuted into an intensely emotional and deeply divisive American debate: the problem of inequality in the United States. Piketty\u00bfs core argument is that throughout history, the rate of return on private capital has usually exceeded the rate of economic growth, expressed by Piketty as the relation r > g. If true, this relation means that the wealthy class\u00bfwho are the predominant owners of capital\u00bfwill grow their wealth faster than economies grow, which means that relatively speaking, the nonwealthy will fall behind. But even if we accept Piketty\u00bfs assertion that this has been a \u00bfhistorical fact,\u00bf why is r > g most of the time? Piketty offers a few economic factors and a few legal rules, but mostly demurs as to why the \u00bfforces of [wealth] divergence\u00bf generally overwhelm the \u00bfforces of [wealth] convergence.\u00bf This Essay argues that legal rules and institutions exhibit an inherent bias toward some forms of private capital and serve to inflate returns to private capital\u00bfPiketty\u00bfs r.

While the Court purported to follow International Shoe and its two prior decisions on general jurisdiction, this simply is not so. Nor does the Court justify its use of an analogy to the traditional basis of domicile to determine to legitimate scope of contacts based jurisdiction. Arguably, an analogy to presence would be more apt. Worse, these two cases, when added to the Court's grudging approach to specific jurisdiction, put some plaintiffs at risk of being unable to bring a defendant to justice in an American court. Goodyear and Daimler could have been decided on far narrower grounds; the Court should read them in the future to be limited to those grounds.",

In comparison with the current Supreme Court standard, Fish argues that he does not have courts engage in the difficult task of interpreting congressional intent. Instead, he would allow severability as the default, with only very limited exceptions where the legislative branch has indicated inseverability. Of course, the best way to prevent judges from acting as legislators is to prevent them from treating something that was not passed by the legislature as law. The only way to do that, with one hundred percent certainty, is to follow a rule of inseverability, which I advocated in my article, Severability of Statutes, to which Mr. Fish offers some critical attention. So, if the \u00bfmain benefit\u00bf truly is to constrain judges, inseverability wins over severability every time. With inseverability, the court voids a statute, and Congress gets to legislate anew.",

      "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/64/online/caron.pdf",
      "abstract": "Since publication of an English edition in March 2014, Capital in the Twenty-First Century has spawned heated debates in newspapers, magazines, and blogs, which soon will continue in academic journals and law reviews. Shi-Ling Hsu is one of the first out of the gate with The Rise and Rise of the One Percent: Considering Legal Causes of Wealth Inequality. Hsu\u00bfs essay is a significant contribution to what is certain to be an energetic debate over the implications of Piketty\u00bfs work. I offer here two modest reactions to Hsu\u00bfs essay: (1) recent inequality research has shifted the focus of high-end wealth concentration from the Top 1% to the Top 0.1% (and even the Top 0.01%), with important implications for the work of both Piketty and Hsu, including (2) the inquiry into whether policymakers should intervene before the fact to reshape the distribution of the benefits and burdens of economic activity (Hsu\u00bfs approach) or instead redistribute wealth after the fact (Piketty\u00bfs approach).",

      "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/64/online/kelly.pdf",
      "abstract": "This essay is a review of and a response to Urban Decay, Austerity, and Rule of Law, an article written by Brent White, Simone Sepe, and Saura Masconale. Building upon an intuitively compelling social contract theory insight, the article sets out the theoretical and empirical cases for the authors\u00bf contention that sustained investment in highly visible, essential local public goods provides crucial support for rule of law. In this invited response, Professor Kelly welcomes the article\u00bfs introduction of the rule of law paradigm to domestic urban policy, finds fault with its selection of public goods that purportedly influence rule of law, and contends that the UDT has far greater potential than the poor support it can offer the authors\u00bf flawed policy proposal. By conceptualizing the domestic urban policy goal as rule of law rather than order, the authors open measurements of success to go beyond crime rates and majoritarian perceptions of personal safety.",

But Professor Arcila also argues that the potential incorporation of predictive policing reflects a larger deficiency in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence and that it should not be adopted because it fails to adequately consider and respect a broader range of protected interests.",

He finds that Professor Kozel's thesis is, on the one hand, both bold and potentially far-reaching, but on the other, counterintuitive and inconsistent with our most basic understandings of the judicial role in our legal system. Professor Terrell evaluates Professor Kozel's recent article, and identifies several points of disagreement.",

Professor Hockett argues that a tight link exists between how we configure and conduct our enterprise and how we configure and conduct our finance. He argues further that we cannot fully describe what an optimally inclusive and sustainable banking and broader financial system would look like without also identifying an optimally participatory productive culture and attendant mode of capital accumulation.",
