While most critics have focused on the expansion of Medicaid and the individual mandate, the rest of the bill is by no means universally praised. One such controversial provision is the Medical Loss Ratio (MLR). Congress crafted the MLR with the purpose to improve patient care and reduce unnecessary administrative spending and excessive corporate profits. Those companies which do not, in a given year, spend the mandated amount on patient care, as opposed to other expenses, must make up the difference by providing a rebate to their policyholders. The purpose of the rebate is both to provide an incentive for insurance companies to comply with government regulations regarding revenue apportionment and compensate consumers who have been \u00bfshortchanged.\u00bf This Perspective will (1) show that the MLR is constitutional, (2) but that it is nevertheless poor policy, and (3) suggest some alternatives for Congress to consider should it repeal and replace the ACA.",

One point of apparent inconsistency is that while botanical marijuana continues to be highly disputed, synthetic versions of marijuana are legally produced and marketed nationwide by Big Pharma corporations. As the door continues to open for marijuana as a legal medical alternative, Big Pharma may be faced with a significant competitive adversary. There is some evidence to suggest that Big Pharma will respond by using its deep pockets not only to prevent legalization, but also to prevent research that would inform consumers of the beneficial effects of botanical marijuana vs. its synthetic counterpart.",

Furthermore, the Paper will argue that squaring up the degrees of social media privacy with the idea that liability for both statutory and common-law invasion of privacy claims turn on court\u00bfs binary perception of privacy requires holding that employees who have utilized any privacy settings should be ruled to have taken steps to remove the communication from the online public sphere, and thus has a reasonable and protectable expectation of privacy.",

Instead of having to argue in court that it did not politically discriminate against Damore, Google should be able to concede that it did so and argue that the decision to fire Damore was in the best interests of the company.

        "abstract": "Many states are increasing pressure on Congress to regulate online businesses. Since online businesses do not have an in-state \u00bfphysical presence,\u00bf they are not subjected to collecting state sales and use taxes. Many states believe that these tax-breaks allow out-of-state sellers to \u00bftake advantage of the local customer base\u00bf without adding to the states\u00bf sales or use tax base. Additionally, many \u00bfbrick and mortar\u00bf stores view the tax-breaks given to online businesses as \u00bfunfair price advantages.\u00bf There have been several Congressional responses to the states\u00bf plea for market fairness. These include: (1) the Market Place Fairness Act; (2) The Remote Transactions Parity Act; (3) The No Regulation Without Representation Act; and (4) the Online Sales Simplification Act. However, this perspective proposes that states create notice and reporting procedures for online businesses that allow states to collect sales and use taxes from their citizens without requiring online businesses to do so.",

        "abstract": "Using various law journal studies, newspaper articles, Congress\u00bfs bill and a recent DOJ Settlement, Zalak Raval examines wolf-pack activism in recent years. The perspective begins by addressing how wolf packs exploit targeted industries. It explains how a wolf pack\u00bfs investment strategy has a detrimental effect on target companies. Specially because the SEC shareholder disclosure rules are uncertain pertaining to the formation of a group, i.e. for shareholders who own less than five percent stock in the company. This in turn opens up loopholes for activists to exploit. The perspective specifically discusses the loopholes used by activists pertaining to Section 13(d) of the Williams Act. It then discusses the U.S. Congress's commitment to curb uncertainty surrounding wolf pack investment strategy, specifically via the Brokaw bill. This perspective advocates for the bill to be signed into law to provide clear enforceable law for shareholders and courts. It also brings to forefront the recent ValueAct settlement, which has closed yet another loophole used by activists, specifically the 13(d)-one narrow exemption for passive investors. Finally, the perspective suggests additional factors that might be helpful in curbing the unchecked wolf packs investment strategy.",

The Commission\u00bfs decision is the biggest blow to date in what seems to be a struggle between the European Union and multinational companies over special tax agreements some companies have with certain Member States. After a brief background of the events leading up to the Commission\u00bfs decision, Szycowski details arguments in favor of and against the decision. This examination finds that regardless of the result of the appeals, multinational companies need not panic, because the Commission can only order the repayment of taxes for a ten-year period, no punitive damages are attached here, the decision so far does not carry any precedential power, and Ireland also plans to appeal.",

The study explains the nature of power in corporate board rooms to reveal the role of proxy advisory firms and highlight that two firms essentially control decisions in corporate board rooms. H.R. 5311 aims to protect investors by providing increased government oversight of publically-held companies through greater SEC regulation of these influential proxy advisors. The analysis highlights that the proxy-advisory market is highly monopolized, which results in unsubstantiated and often harmful voting recommendations. In sum, the current system disregards investor\u00bfs expectations that their shareholder rights will not be weakened by conflicted third party advisors whose recommendations influence institutional investor voting patterns, and thus guide board room decisions. This work increases our understanding of the proxy advisory market, and calls attention to an overwhelming need for more effective corporate governance in this area.",

The articles posit that the Federal Circuit has extended liability to corporate officers through piercing the corporate veil, despite veil-piercing traditionally applying to shareholders. Fialkow argues that these conclusions result from confusing liability for someone who is both an officer and a shareholder with liability for someone who is just an officer. Ultimately, Fialkow makes the distinction that the Federal Circuit\u00bfs erroneous belief that finding any employee personally liable for corporate activities is considered piercing the corporate veil is merely dicta. In fact, the Federal Circuit has not created a new set of rules for personal liability in patent infringement.",

This Perspective informs the reader about CSR by discussing how companies address specific issues like climate change and sexual orientation.

As the boundaries of rule breaking may lead to slippery slopes, Jain analyzes food and drug law policies that could impose criminal and civil penalties on executives.

After comparing these options, Jain highlights the difficulty in proving inappropriate executive behavior and the issue of enforcement due to increased costs and limited resources.",

Since an off-shore listed company cannot hold equity interests in the operating company in mainland China due to restrictive regulations in foreign investment, the VIE structure utilizes various types of contractual arrangements to gap the loophole where the listed company should play the role of shareholder in the lucrative mainland business. In spite of the complex covenants, this study by analyzing different VIE agreements\u00bf function and actual effects finds that listed companies in VIE structures can merely have limited control over profit-transferring process without any decision-making power.

This article specifically focuses the geopolitical nature of the oil supply and its impact on certain oil assets. The research indicates that difficult to extract oil resources such as fracking and tar sands are taking an economic hit. However, the same research indicates that long-term the oil market will rebound. What that means for difficult to extract resources is that they will not be profitable for immediate production but will be a valuable asset long term as the oil market balances itself out. Thus companies who are involved in energy investments should be careful not to unload these resources but should probably minimize short-term production and avoid bringing new reserves on-line until the market rebounds.",

Kahn\u00bfs Perspective explains that there is no international law that applies directly to corporations, as the UN lacks the jurisdiction to enforce it. Domestic law does not serve to protect human rights against TNCS either. She looks at one case in particular, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, as an example of how severely outdated domestic law fails to provide justice to victims of TNC abuses. Kahn concludes with the notion that the United States should be a part of creating and enforcing an international treaty in an effort to stop TNCs human rights abuses and offer victims a venue for justice.",

        "abstract": "In light of recent litigation against Vemma Nutrition Co. by the Federal Trade Commission, Jeremy Pineres examines the compensation structures of multi-level marketing companies with a focus on the various shortcomings of these companies that lead to quasi-pyramid scheme business practices. During a time where the internet provides consumers instant access to competitive pricing, multi-level marketing companies nevertheless offer products and services that are largely unsellable. Generally, the price and quality of these marketed products and services are unable to compete with store-bought items. When combined with a compensation structure that financially rewards and encourages new member recruitment over bona fide retail sales, the resulting business practice resembles a pyramid scheme in all but its name. After analyzing the various factors that create and encourage the questionable practices of these companies, Pineres forecasts how the court\u00bfs ultimate ruling could form the basis for several changes within the industry.",

        "abstract": "The cyber attack on Sony Pictures may have a much bigger impact on the American public than merely restricting the platforms on which they can watch the latest Seth Rogan movie. The highly publicized security breach revealed that America\u00bfs enemies are no longer just armed with guns and explosives. Instead, our adversaries are increasingly using cyber weapons that can present an even greater threat to America\u00bfs security interests. Both Senator McCain and President Obama blame the administration\u00bfs lack of effective cyber security legislation as a major contributing factor for what happened to Sony. As a result, bolstering cyber protection legislation has become a top priority for lawmakers in 2015. However, many of the bills being proposed to Congress bear a heavy price tag for the American people. In exchange for increased cyber protection, controversial bills like CISPA and CISA will grant the government greater access to the public\u00bfs private information.",

        "abstract": "\u00bfBig data\" refers to massive amounts of information ranging from a combination of clinical, genetic, social and other data that is collected from multiple sources and interpreted by analytics to provide an overview of trends or patterns. Physicians hope to use this data to identify patients who are at risk for certain illnesses and thus, likely to be \u00bfhigh-cost\u00bf, meaning repeat users of expensive health care services. Big data can certainly be useful for treating healthy patients as well. The hope is that it will be able to predict who's likely to have a health issue later in his/her lifetime. Many believe that big data can help anticipate patient needs. Though patients can benefit from consumer data, the financial motivations and privacy implications for this cannot be overlooked. This article seeks to explain the impact of big data and offer ways to manage the associated risk.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/ecgar/_documents/volumes/2/1/kim.pdf",
        "abstract": "With a growing reliance on oversea suppliers, electronics companies such as Apple have encountered the troubling issue of foreign labor abuse. It has been well-documented that several oversea suppliers have provided an unsafe working environment for their employees. Such abuses include instances of forced overtime and the improper handling of chemicals among other violations. In spite of these violations of employee labor rights, oversea suppliers often fail to address such issues despite labor policies put in place by these electronics companies. This essay seeks to establish the need for greater corporate transparency to combat these issues while also offering alternative ways to further expose and address the problem of foreign labor abuse.",
