        "abstract": "COVID-19 became an international pandemic affecting every country and threatening a global economic collapse. This Article examines countries' obligations under public international law to prevent and contain pandemics, and subsequent responsibilities to help other countries during pandemics. International Human Rights law recognizes a right to health and includes obligations. Nonetheless, it lacks a sufficient enforcement mechanism. Pandemics are analogous to war; therefore, the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) can help as countries utilize R2P to protect against atrocities. This Article argues that R2P is not merely a responsibility to protect against the worst that humankind has to offer but against the worst that can be offered to humankind.",

        "abstract": "On June 23, 2016, British citizens voted in a non-binding referendum to leave the European Union (EU). The withdrawal, ever since adorned with the coinage \u201cBrexit,\u201d was a decision their leaders chose to enforce. In addition to being non-binding, the vote was close; it did not resemble the supermajority often associated with referendums. In the case of Scotland, for example, not one Scottish local government area voted to leave the EU, though Moray came close with 49.9% of the area voting for Brexit. Although Scotland as a whole rejected the referendum by 62%, the country represents only 8.4% of the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) population. As a result, its vote to stay in the EU, along with that of Northern Ireland (which accounts for 2.9% of the UK\u2019s population), was heavily outweighed by the \u201cLeave\u201d votes of much-larger units England and Wales.",

This rapid growth led the European Union to enact a new electronic signature regulation (eIDAS) in 2016, creating an infrastructure for electronic signatures that facilitates e-commerce. Because standards in the United States, based on the E-Sign Act of 2000, are outdated and inefficient, it is imperative that the United States takes an affirmative step to increase the efficiency of international e-commerce. By using the European model to add clarification to its existing regulations, the United States can streamline the uniform signature standard for patent assignments in a way that allows business and agencies to increase efficiency in the workplace.",

But, these recent alterations also provide a significant opportunity for states to write the terms of the international economic system in a manner that deliberately respects and protects the fundamental human rights of communities, individuals, and groups that comprise states\u00bf populations. These human rights commitments are arguably an intrinsic part of states\u00bf social contracts with its citizens.

While the Security Council and the Permanent Members are often criticized, the criticism is misplaced and reflects a widespread misunderstanding of the Security Council\u00bfs structure, nature, and purpose.

Today, espionage serves as a way to elicit knowledge that allows states to both gain superiority over adversaries and allies and also safeguard their own information from the prying hands of others. But, states often engage in espionage activities while deriding similar acts of others, producing an interesting contradiction. As a result, many states have created various espionage statutes to define the acts and their subsequent consequences. In a government for the people, states must weigh their commitment to transparency and democratic ideals against their commitment to national security and protecting their secrets. One common defense employed by Canada is the public interest defense. While the United States does not employ such a defense, these two democratic nations provide an interesting comparison as to the practicality and efficacy of such a defense.",

A question that Control Firsters must address is whether it is prudent for taxpayers to trust the governments of the 117 countries that scored a fifty or below on Transparency International\u00bfs corruption index. Quite possibly, the complete information system invoked by Control Firsters encourages, even prolongs, the bad behavior by providing fuel (financial information) to feed the fire of corruption and suppression of rivals.

The UK Government, EU officials, leaders of EU Member States, as well as the media and academics often discuss Brexit in terms of what is legally permissible. These legal debates have focused for the most part on questions arising under either UK constitutional law or under EU law. What has been missing from this debate, however, are the possible questions that might arise under international law. For decades, the EU has been active on the international plane, entering into agreements in fields such as trade, fisheries, and so on. As the UK seeks to disentangle itself from these complex legal relationships, international law plays a role at each level.

The Essay considers the United States\u00bf obligations under international human rights law to protect both the freedom of immigration and the freedom of religion, as well as the United States\u00bf compelling interest to protect national security. Professor Samar concludes that such a policy cannot be justified under the First Amendment Establishment Clause, as well the United States\u00bf expressed international commitments to preserving international human rights.",

        "abstract": "In this Essay, J. Gregory Sidak examines the use of economists as arbitrators or tribunal-appointed neutral experts in international arbitration in effort to raise the standard of party-expert testimony and expedite the determination of quantum. Mr. Sidak argues that either approach would expedite arbitration by causing parties to submit more realistic estimates of quantum and to explain in a more systematic and helpful manner the robustness of those estimates and the assumptions underlying them. Gregory Sidak draw insights from his experience as a court-appointed neutral economic expert on damages for Judge Richard Posner in two patent litigations. Sidak concludes that both the selection of an arbitrator with economic expertise and the tribunal\u00bfs appointment of a neutral economic expert would create greater benefits than costs for the parties to the arbitration.",

        "abstract": "In this essay, Pat Andriola addresses the legality of Israel\u00bfs Operation Protective Edge launched against Hamas in the Gaza territory in the summer of 2014. The essay analyzes whether the legal action taken by Israel comports with customary international humanitarian law, specifically, the principles of distinction and proportionality, and whether there is in fact international law governing Israel\u00bfs actions and use of force. Pat Andriola concludes that Israel\u00bfs actions were governed by international law, as evident by Israel\u00bfs attempts to warn civilians of incoming attacks. The essay continues to conclude that Israel most likely did not comply with the proportionality requirement, as the threat of Israeli deaths as a result of the Hamas rocket attacks was relatively minor.",

        "abstract": "The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released the Report on Rendition, Detention, and Interrogation in December 2014 detailing the use of enhanced interrogation techniques by the United States after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Defenders of enhanced interrogation often justify the use of such techniques based on military necessity and efficacy. In this essay, Benjamin Farley argues that by relying on military necessity, defenders of enhanced interrogation techniques are actually relying on kriegsraison\u00bfa long-discredited military doctrine that holds that the laws of war may be overcome in the face of extreme danger or simply to achieve the object of the war. The essay examines the clear and continuing rejection of kriegsraison at international law and traces the development of arguments justifying enhanced interrogation. Benjamin Farley urges for the rejection of any arguments based upon the doctrine of kriegsraison and upon using torture as an effective means of warfare.",

The essay highlights several consequences of recognizing such a global NIAC, including incidental civilian harm and destruction of civilian property, to conclude that the very existence of a global NIAC violates international law, particularly as it pertains to the rights of the territorial state. As a result, states subjects to attack must rely upon international law concepts other than a global NIAC to justify their extraterritorial use of force. The essay details several alternative legal avenues that would be permissible under international law that states may use to defend themselves from violent non-state groups.",

        "abstract": "In response to the public outcry over the death of millions of people in developing countries because of a lack of access to life-saving drugs, the World Trade Organization (WTO) recognized the need for developing countries to obtain pharmaceutical drugs at a reduced rate. However, the WTO received significant pushback from patent holders and pharmaceutical companies who insisted that their patents be upheld in every country. The dilemma resulted in the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and the 2003 Doha Declaration. Despite these efforts, millions of people are still dying because of a lack of access to pharmaceutical drugs. Arun J. Mohan argues that the only cure for the failure of the TRIPS Agreement and subsequent WTO actions is for the international community to set up a body that oversees the distribution of drugs to developing countries only when national health emergencies occur.",

Other states have acknowledged that the Syrian government acquired its chemical weapons arsenal prior to the August 21, 2013 chemical attack against civilians in the Ghouta agricultural belt. However, the extent of the threat posed was unknown.

To allow for this necessary preparation, the world community should recognize an international human right of all people to live in an environment of self-sufficiency. International law scholars have recognized similar rights and have often mentioned the importance of self-sufficiency in the context of these other rights, but none have yet cited self-sufficiency as an independent right. In this article, Haley Palfreyman Jankowski argues that such a right is inherent to every individual and is a natural outgrowth of several basic recognized human rights.",

Part III assesses whether the Background Papers demonstrate parallel citation lacunae or biases.

If returning children to their home nation would pose a grave risk to their safety, it is acceptable for them to remain with the abducting parent until courts make an official custody determination. A circuit split currently exists on the affirmative defense of grave risk of harm. Some courts end their analysis once a grave risk of harm is proven. Others, such as the Eighth Circuit in Acosta v. Acosta, take the further step of assessing whether the home nation would take measures to protect the children if they were returned.
