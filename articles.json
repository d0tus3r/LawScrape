        "abstract": "The community of NATO has grown considerably since the North Atlantic Treaty was signed on April 4, 1949. The NATO community contains a vast network of legal advisors and contributors who have provided much toward the growth and development of the North Atlantic Alliance itself. This Article starts by addressing a few of the historical events that lead to the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, followed by events taking place in today\u00bfs time that reflect the contributions of the NATO legal community. The Article brings to light the motivating ideas and factors that have led the NATO legal community to reflect on the purpose and establishment of the North Atlantic Alliance, directed toward both the global landscape in 1949 and today in 2019. Lastly, the Article gives a comprehensive review of the legal commentary on the North Atlantic Treaty.",

The trauma and destruction that resulted from the horrific events of the second world war, led to an awareness from the global leaders of the time to establish a uniform defense coalition to combat growing threats and to protect the ideals of Western democracy. This Article serves to analyze the origins of the North Atlantic Treaty, by highlighting the competing interests and global sentiments that went into the countless negotiations and revolving participants that led up to the treaty\u00bfs formation. Significantly, this Article draws attention to the events and debates that led up to the involvement of the United States in the North Atlantic Treaty. The Article positions itself in the middle of the modern global climate and questions the direction and purpose of the North Atlantic Alliance in the future.",

These observations serve as a reminder of the contributions of NATO in the past, as well as the development of the NATO community as it continues on into the present. The ten observations address new perspectives and fundamental changes in regards to the international relationships both created and strengthened by the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. The ten observations go on to discuss the following: an outward looking legal community; the law pertaining to international organizations; a new important perspective; fundamental changes as a defense organization; common changes not unique to NATO; common characteristics to international organizations; external relations between international organizations; arising legal issues and challenges; immunity granted to international organizations; and the accountability of international organizations.",

This Article considers the mutual values and motivating ideas of the North Atlantic Alliance, putting emphasis on the continuation for all joining parties to the North Atlantic Treaty. The values that motivated the North Atlantic Treaty during its formation continue to frame the context of the North Atlantic Treaty today.

This had a magnifying effect due to the global trauma and destruction that had been witnessed by the world following World War II. This Article visits the realities of history that led to the formation of NATO as a collective measure for self-defense and the effectiveness it had as a response to global concern of peace preservation. Importantly, this Article analyzes the substantive military functioning articles of the North Atlantic Treaty, namely Article 5. This Article serves to provide a reflection on the instability and overwhelming concerns that motivated the creation of NATO and its rippling effect felt globally as a responsory action. Lastly, this Article positions collective self-defense in the context off issues faced in 2019 and how it serves to respond to them.",

The Article first provides a brief conceptual and historical context. It then introduces the empirical study and its methodology. This Article uses data from government web sites, official reports, and social media sites to examine popular participation, its constitution, and its limitations. The Article develops four distinct data sets around which the analysis of popular participation is undertaken. Part IV then considers consequences and applications both within Cuba and beyond as they may point to the further development of the Cuban form of Marxist-Leninist political theory around structures of democratic mechanisms.",

Following events like Russia\u2019s successful attack on the United States 2016 presidential election and growing threats of interference from China to Australia\u2019s democratic process, Australia became the first country to completely overhaul its national security and foreign political interference laws through broad, sweeping reform. While its new legislation aims to provide greater transparency between the Australian government and the public, the impulsive and hastily drafted laws have given rise to the potential for many unwanted consequences. This Comment brings to light some of the most significant changes to Australia\u2019s national security and foreign political interference laws and contemplates the potential repercussions. Further, this Comment compares the United States\u2019 legislative framework for protections against foreign political interference to Australia\u2019s new laws and proposes a solution to correct Australia\u2019s failed reformations.",

        "abstract": "Central banks are flocking to government-backed cryptocurrency, taking full advantage of the media attention brought to Bitcoin and other digital currency. However, while government-backed cryptocurrency avoids some pitfalls presented by private cryptocurrencies, other problems are less easily sidestepped. And government-backed cryptocurrencies, if widely adopted, could present issues to the stability of the international monetary system. These problems must be addressed, and not only as they arise. Unfortunately, national and international governments have shown no real ability to deal with troubles arising from private cryptocurrency. The government-backing of such digital currency changes the calculus, permitting a new entity to deal with these problems. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is the best organization to deal with the issues. This Note submits that the IMF should act quickly to take pre-emptive measures and develop a system of best practices for dealing with government-backed cryptocurrency in pursuance of ensuring a stable international monetary system.",

In Part III, China\u2019s approach to global economic development is explored in a discussion of China\u2019s RBI initiative, the primary motivation for the US change in global investment strategy. Part IV analyzes investments in health systems and the opportunity the U.S. has to invest in health system projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. Part V proposes the implementation of guidelines and regulations on the IDFC during the transition period as the detailed plan of IDFC awaits approval from Congress. Finally, Part VI then reaches the conclusion that the direction that the IDFC appears to be taking is detrimental regarding its foreign relations with Sub-Saharan Africa as the US shifts from an aid to trade-based approach.",

Argentine law currently considers abortion a crime with the exception of two narrowly defined circumstances that are rarely applied. The legalization of abortion is vitally important to the women in Argentina who face an increased risk of femicide. Femicide rates in Latin America are among the highest in the world. Femicide can be linked specifically to pregnant women who could not get an abortion and continued facing violence from the man involved in the pregnancy, which ultimately then resulted in their death. This Comment proposes that the legalization of abortion could potentially reduce the rates of femicide of pregnant women and can definitely reduce the amount of violence against women.",

The courts or Congress should create an exception to the Alien Tort Statute for foreign corporate subsidiaries of domestic corporations. This exception will help improve American soft power and will hold human rights violators liable for their crimes. This Comment examines the policies of countries like France, England, Canada, and the Netherlands. The exception proposed by this Comment differs from the policies in these countries because it only asks the U.S. to create an exception for foreign corporations owned by American companies.

The Security Council resolutions adopted since 2008 underscore a diplomatic renaissance in which decisions unfold with unparalleled frequency: Measures impacting naval engagements that were adopted about once every 1.7 years are now approved every 2.5 months.

The Rome Statute\u00bfs definition of the crime of aggression reflecting on existing practice leads to the assumption that State-like entities that lack universal recognition will not be covered by the Court\u00bfs jurisdiction of the crime of aggression. Lack of clear definition of \u00bfState\u00bf in the Rome Statute gives the first indication of the implied exclusion of State-like entities from the scope of the crime of aggression. However, the most recent interpretation of the term \u00bfState\u00bf as provided by the International Criminal Court (ICC) delivers even more persuasive evidence, reinforcing the argument that these entities would not be covered by this amendment. This Article argues that uncertainty or explicit exclusion of these entities are both illegitimate; based on historical, legal and practical analyses respectively. Further, this Article examines how to reconcile these entities with the definition of the crime of aggression.",

After decades in the making and to its detractors\u00bf vexation, the ICC is now a fact of life. Its hurdles are no longer existential but experiential. The ongoing saga surrounding Omar al-Bashir exemplifies the Court\u00bfs current challenges in bringing perpetrators of atrocities to justice and fulfilling the promise of accountability. This Comment posits that, on the eve of the Rome Statute\u00bfs \u00bfplatinum anniversary,\u00bf the ICC demonstrated its growing diplomatic maturity with a strategic pre-trial decision regarding a Member State\u00bfs flouting of its obligation to deliver the Sudanese president to justice. The ruling ostensibly concerned South Africa\u00bfs culpability for non-compliance with the ICC\u00bfs outstanding arrest warrant for al-Bashir\u00bfs alleged crimes under the court\u00bfs jurisdiction, including genocide and crimes against humanity.

To improve the current state of America\u00bfs criminal justice system it is imperative that the we look to other countries to determine how to provide justice in a more cost-efficient manner. In 2011 the United Kingdom piloted a Payment-by-Results (PbR) program, a form of incentive-based payments, in a number of their private prisons. The purpose of the PbR program was to encourage private prison providers to find creative ways to lower reconviction rates to receive a bonus payment. This Comment focuses on the PbR programs in the U.K. and their applicability to prisons in the United States. This Comment proposes that both private and public prisons at the state and federal levels in the United States should begin implementing PbR programs to decrease prison populations and costs and increase prisoner wellbeing.",

A qualitative analysis of two historical moments when India was confronted with an empirical conflict of the CEDAW\u00bfs due diligence obligation: the sati of Roop Kanwar in 1987 and the Shah Bano judgment in 1985, even prior to its CEDAW accession in 1993 is undertaken, to argue that the rational choice theory of voting and elections perfectly explains non-compliance.

In the context of post-conflict Iraq, Resolution 1325 not only rendered Iraqi women more vulnerable as symbols of western invasion but failed to address the crumbling state infrastructure that left women without electricity, clean drinking water, employment, food, and security. This Comment argues that the \u00bfadd women and stir\u00bf equality of Resolution 1325 must be abandoned in favor of reconstruction following Martha Fineman\u00bfs Vulnerability Theory. Vulnerability Theory focuses instead on rebuilding the political, economic, and social infrastructure of the post-conflict state, ameliorating the conditions that exacerbate vulnerability, recognizing that poverty, diminished access to life-saving resources, unemployment, and insecurity intersect with gender to perpetuate suffering and violence.",

        "abstract": "In the aftermath of September 11 attacks, China has not been immune to the global trend of destructive terrorism. However, China\u00bfs perceptions of terrorism and legal responses to it greatly diverge from those of other countries. This Article first seeks to understand the cause, source, and impact of terrorist threats in China, known as \u00bfThree Evils\u00bf\u00bfterrorism, extremism, and separatism, through a critical inquiry of the country\u00bfs ethnic and religious policies. It then proceeds to delineate China\u00bfs legal framework for combating the \u00bfThree Evils\u00bf to explore the cultural characteristics of the government\u00bfs approach against these rising threats. Tracing the evolution of the country\u00bfs counter-terrorism laws and policies, this Article argues that China has developed an operational infrastructure composed of four strands to fight terrorism: crackdown, criminalization, control, and cooperation. This framework of \u00bffour Cs\u00bf operates within a vertically coordinated system by deploying diverse strategies and measures to regulate terrorism-related acts according to their level of severity and risk. While crackdown and criminalization serve mainly as reactive responses to terrorist violence through repression and retribution, control and cooperation are largely used as pre-emptive instruments to prevent substantial terrorist acts through incapacitation and community policing.",

What has not been explored is whether their removal from the United States might implicate international law, and, specifically, whether it would constitute a crime against humanity. On its face, it seems to be an outrageous claim: that deporting non-citizens from a state would be a criminal act. International law protects a State\u00bfs ability to remove unlawfully present aliens. This is not in debate. The argument is, however, far narrower. Specifically, the forcible, arbitrary deportation of Dreamers with an intent to permanently remove them from their residence, which is protected under international law, would be criminal.",

The vulnerability of Afro-Colombians and their land rights have greatly impacted the instability in the nation. Throughout the civil conflict, numerous bloody skirmishes occurred on the arable lands of Afro-Colombian. These bloody skirmishes will continue because of the desire of criminal non-government actors to take the arable land and use it for profit. This Comment proposes that to protect Afro-Colombians and their lands the Colombian government should communicate with Afro-Colombians and implement a stronger policy of consulta previa by using the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People as a guideline and by granting Afro-Colombians the ability to veto the plans that are presented to them.",

        "abstract": "Almost half of India still does not have a bank account, leaving millions of Indians unable to access traditional sources of credit. For these unbanked Indians, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms have become an important alternative credit source. A recent boom in P2P platforms caused the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to create a regulatory framework for the P2P sector. This Comment seeks to address some of the issues concerning regulating an unconventional industry that provides a crucial service. First, it is argued that the RBI fundamentally mischaracterizes both the services P2P\u00bfs provide, and how P2P\u00bfs provide these services. The Comment then discusses challenges P2P regulation poses for the RBI, arguing that the RBI\u00bfs framework both over- and underregulates P2P platforms. Finally, this Comment recommends India adopt U.S. P2P regulations, allowing for an exemption-based approach to lending. Given that alternative credit is much needed in India, this comment hopes to better tailor current regulations, in order to avoid a total regulatory overhaul.",

        "abstract": "The Hatch-Waxman Act created the modern pharmaceutical regulatory approval process in the United States. The drafters of Hatch-Waxman sought to balance incentives for branded pharmaceutical company investment in innovative therapies with incentives for accelerated market entry of generic pharmaceuticals. Today, thirty years after enactment, the Hatch-Waxman balance has shifted. Branded pharmaceutical companies routinely exploit Hatch-Waxman loopholes to block generic competitors from entering the market. After much public outcry, United States officials have prioritized closing these loopholes. This Comment proposes Hatch-Waxman reforms which follow South Korea\u00bfs pharmaceutical regulatory approval process. South Korea modeled its system on Hatch-Waxman yet made it more difficult for pharmaceutical companies to delay generic competitors. The United States need not adopt South Korea\u00bfs system verbatim. Rather, South Korea\u00bfs system should be used as a guide for restoring the intended Hatch-Waxman balance, promoting competition in the marketplace, and lowering drug prices in the United States.",

Even tough Islamic scholars\u00bfShia and Sunni\u00bfagree on mandating the highest level of legal knowledge in any member of the Islamic government, they disagree on the legal nature of these members, whether they are judges, or jurists. Shia Islamic scholars adopted the theory of the guardianship of the jurist (Wilayat al-Faqih in Arabic, or Vilayat e-Faqih in Farsi). Unlike Sunni scholars, the Shia has developed a practical approach to apply their theory of government in practice. A prominent example of this theory is the Iranian practice of the Guardianship of the Jurist Theory. Sunni Islamic scholars adopt the theory of government by judiciary (Wilayat Al-Qadi). The assumption of this theory is that member of the government are judges. This is based on the assumption that Prophet Mohamed was a judge with enumerated executive authorities, namely the collection of Sadaqat (state financial revenue), military power, and foreign affairs\u00bf representation. This theory has never been in practice since the assassination of the first four successors of the Prophet.",

        "abstract": "The United States\u00bf and Cuba\u00bfs strained relationship exists, at least in part, due to a fundamental disagreement as to the definition of human rights. While this relationship has warmed in recent years, the United States still has an embargo imposed on Cuba, prohibiting U.S. business development in Cuba until the Cuban government commits to democratization and human rights reform. A bilateral investment treaty between the two nations can help facilitate both human rights development and increased foreign investment in Cuba. Such a treaty could require an examination of human rights impacts on Cubans before investors could commit funds to the nation and, in turn, would provide mechanisms to protect investment interests. Creating a bilateral investment treaty with the inclusion of human rights clauses would promote U.S. interests in Cuba by providing protection for Cuban citizens while allowing investors to commit capital to the nation.",

        "abstract": "Women and men have never been treated equally when it comes to the division of care labor worldwide, and international law replicates this inequality. While women are more empowered now than ever before, women still bear the primary responsibility for caring for children and performing housework. In order to combat global gender inequality, international law must embrace more gender-neutral standards. One way to do so is to link labor to trade through the World Trade Organization, incorporating gender-neutral labor standards in a way that imposes substantive obligations on Member States. As a result, the imposition of paid paternity leave at the international level could help overcome traditional social attitudes toward care labor that would foster gender equality both in the home and in the workplace.",

In 2016, the European Council and the European Parliament enacted the General Data Protection Regulation to provide a uniform normative framework for the RTBF that harmonized data protection across the European Union. The GDPR provoked heated criticism because it may sway search engine providers to accept every request to eliminate data from the Internet and harm the right to freedom of information. This Comment argues that the new normative framework of the RTBF is consistent with the well-established protection of the right to respect for private life recognized and protected under the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights. It also argues that the GDPR will not harm the right to information because the structure of the Internet market will safeguard the right to information and the search engine\u00bfs economic rights.",

This approach has the potential to inform implementation worldwide, specifically in the United States. Rather than militarization, which has eroded trust between residents and police forces, the Nicaraguan model offers a return to policing in partnership with the community it serves. There is no \u00bfone size fits all\u00bf approach, but a commitment to building trust between police departments and the communities in which they serve\u00bfcoupled with political commitment\u00bfwill lead to the public legitimacy that Nicaragua\u00bfs neighbors and the United States so desperately need.",

One of the emerging harms of the existing interpretation of the Helms Amendment is the threat that the policy poses toward infectious disease prevention efforts in Latin America. Instead, Congress and executive agencies, like USAID, should interpret the text of the Helms Amendment narrowly, applying it to prevent abortion services only in true instances where abortion is used as a substitute for family planning.",

The practice of conserving these artworks is controversial because some significant restorations have resulted in removing important aspects of the original works or painting over them entirely.

This Comment proposes that an international committee should review proposals to restore artworks before the projects begin. The proposed committee would consider the potential risks and weigh them against the benefits, discouraging museums from entering into these projects hastily. Museums would need to use standardized conservation techniques and procedures. The regulation of this industry and museums would result in conservations that are of excellent quality, rather than done in great quantity. In doing so, this committee would help to protect paintings from continuous efforts to save them.",

An analysis of the antidumping duty assessed by the U.S. Department of Commerce on garlic imports from China reveals two things: first, how difficult it is to calculate tariffs on imports from non-market economies; and second, how unpredictable the final duty imposed often is. This Comment then proposes a different, more data-driven methodology for calculating antidumping duties that would likely produce more predictable results while also demonstrating to China a willingness to work towards a solution.",

While these two systems\u00bfthe state-to-state WTO structure and the investor-to-state investment framework\u00bfare typically assessed differently, this empirical study concludes that private parties use investment treaties to litigate many causes of action related to trade and obtain damages for violations of trade laws.

This Article documents the wide heterogeneity of holdout rates across Argentina\u00bfs 150 defaulted bonds and focus the analysis on the seven most held-out bonds. This Article also assesses the returns that investors would have obtained by purchasing the seven-bond basket at different times since 2002. This analysis offers a framework for potential settlement negotiations. However, with so many holdouts unaccounted for, a settlement with the NML litigants exposes Argentina to the tyranny of the next litigant as long as the current injunctions remain in place. There is a benefit of modifying or lifting these injunctions as Argentina begins negotiating in good faith to reach a reasonable settlement with its holdout creditors.",

The authors examine how international economic migration has developed over past years by critical analysis of frameworks found in the Preferential Trade Agreements of the United States, Canada, and Chile, with particular attention to market access and the standard of treatment afforded to temporary migrants. Recent European developments in the area of focused bilateral migration agreements are also discussed in the context of international economic migration. The authors conclude by analyzing the effect of the TPP, the practices it imposed, and the similarities and differences between those practices and the recent practices that have developed through the PTAs.",

In doing so, the United States should look to international standards\u00bfin particular the Bangkok Rules and the Convention on the Rights of the Child\u00bfas well as the criminal justice reform to support incarcerated mothers and their children in Scotland. This Comment proposes that Martha Fineman\u00bfs vulnerability theory provides the United States with a framework to ensure criminal justice reform is accomplished with a goal of reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience in incarcerated mothers and their children, with broader implications for overall reform.",

The 20th century marks the most massive global extinction in Earth\u00bfs history, one that is inextricably connected to the human fingerprint. The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses this global issue, by incentivizing the protection of genetic resources and an endorsing equitable sharing of biological information. The Convention on Biological Diversity, while well intentioned, has not made large strides in reversing global biodiversity loss. This Comment reflects on how the Convention on Biological Diversity has failed to stabilize the decline of biological diversity and urges the United States, a global powerhouse, to finally ratify the Convention.

        "abstract": "In 1980, after a successful immunization campaign, WHO declared that smallpox, a virus that ravaged the human race, was eradicated. Today, the smallpox virus officially exists within two government laboratories: the CDC and Vector. The issue of whether or not to destroy the official stockpiles of the smallpox virus has been vigorously debated. Recent incidents, such as protocol lapses and the discovery of a forgotten stockpile, have further pushed the issue. In an increasingly interconnected world, the outbreak of a highly contagious, eradicated disease is more than disconcerting. The threat of bioterrorism also cannot be ignored as smallpox has been weaponized as an agent of biological warfare before. This Comment advocates for the destruction of the official stockpiles of the smallpox virus through the introduction of a bilateral treaty between the United States and Russia, a proposed United Nations Security Council resolution, and express criminalization of bioterrorism under international law.",

Article 7 of the Rome Statute, on Crimes Against Humanity, reflects this development, but does not address how to resolve the interpretive difficulties that flow from it, particularly as regards the requirement that the crime requires an attack directed against a \u00bfcivilian\u00bf population. This Article analyzes Article 7\u00bfs \u00bfcivilian population\u00bf requirement, and argues it should be understood from the perspective of peacetime, rather than as an outgrowth of international humanitarian law (IHL). It is the first comprehensive and systematic treatment of this issue. The Article rejects ICC Chambers\u00bf reliance upon Article 50 of Protocol I as the relevant test and instead proposes a three-part inquiry to establish whether or not an individual or population is \u00bfcivilian\u00bf in character.",

The use of language analysis for the determination of origin (LADO) in asylum proceedings has led to inconsistencies in the treatment of asylum applications, as different nations use different procedures of analysis. Although it has not responded specifically to the use of LADO, and the European Union has acknowledged the need for equal treatment of asylum applications through the development of the Common European Asylum System. This Comment applies the purpose of the CEAS to the use of LADO and argues that, like the CEAS, an established and trusted LADO procedure must be established. The lack of uniformity in LADO procedures had led to inaccurate conclusions\u00bffor nations to assess asylum applications consistently throughout the European Union, a standard LADO procedure must be implemented in the CEAS.",

This Comment explores the factors behind these rates, including each country\u00bfs penal goals, structures, and laws. Major differentiating factors between the two systems include the sentencing structure of the U.S. and the Norwegian principle of normality. Under the principle of normality, Norway seeks to reintegrate its offenders into society. Norway combats the negative side effects of prison that isolate the prisoner from society, reinforce bad habits, and make reintegration upon release nearly impossible. This Comment proposes that the U.S. could achieve similar results by integrating its current focus on retribution with Norwegian-style rehabilitation. If the U.S. lowered its sentences and incorporated the principle of normality into prisoner treatment, the U.S. and its prisoners would benefit from lower crime and recidivism rates.",

This Article engages in the recurrent debate over effective transnational corporate accountability, offering the first liberalist defense of universal jurisdiction\u00bfs marginalization in U.S. courts.

This Essay argues for greater openness to the benefits of diversity in the legal rules that govern international arbitration. The easy benefits of uniformity have already been obtained, meaning that the marginal benefits of greater uniformity are more limited. At the same time, the costs of uniformity (or the benefits of diversity) are at their greatest when national arbitration laws remain diverse. Rather than simply seeking more uniformity, the goal should be to aim for the optimal degree of uniformity, recognizing that some diversity in international arbitration laws is beneficial.",

Beginning with the United States, many states began to actively seek extraterritorial application of domestic competition laws against foreign entities.

This Comment argues that competition law was formed and developed according to strong domestic economic interests that do not take into consideration the interests of smaller foreign economies that could potentially be harmed by the extraterritorial application of competition law by other states. This Comment proposes that the U.S. Courts, Congress, and competition authorities revisit the principle of international comity laid out by Justice Scalia\u00bfs dissent in Timberlane to prevent competition law from becoming a protectionist tool that protects its domestic interests at the expense of the economic growth of smaller economies.",

In order for progress to be made in combatting the practice of labor trafficking, Thailand must begin to adequately enforce existing anti-trafficking legislation, as well as implement further anti-trafficking measures. Additionally, new maritime labor laws and laws governing Thai waters are necessary for regulation of the illicit activity ongoing in the Thai fishing industry. If Thailand does not take significant steps to eradicate trafficking, it could face sanctions from authorities like the United States State Department and the European Union. A regional authority with jurisdiction over the investigation, prosecution, and deterrence of labor trafficking would aid in combatting this problem. Additionally, it is important that there be more rigorous monitoring of supply chains throughout the world.",

The practice of denying utility services to individuals who cannot provide a social security number (SSN) violates U.S. federal law and is contrary to international human rights norms and obligations. This Article discusses options for challenging these policies under U.S. law, specifically under the Privacy Act and the Fair Housing Act (FHA). It then analyzes how such utility service denials violate international human rights treaties and norms regarding security of the person, adequate standards of living, the right to water, and the right to equal treatment. Together, these domestic and international legal authorities provide a basis for immigrants\u00bf rights and human rights advocates to challenge these policies in court and lobby against the adoption of such policies.",

Professor Aleinikoff suggests that through new technology and new media, refugees are beginning to foster new forms of community.

        "abstract": "Following the shocking results of the Brexit referendum in June 2016 and the Greek referendum rejecting austerity measures in 2015, many believe that the EU is undergoing a legitimacy crisis. The most vocal Eurosceptics claim that the EU threatens individual Member State sovereignty, with the chief concern being that the EU\u00bfs decision-making mechanisms are leaving certain Member States overruled in major decisions. This Comment explores the decision-making mechanisms employed at the supranational level of the EU, with a particular focus on the EU\u00bfs sanctions regime, revealing the heart of the struggle between efficiency in decision-making and preservation of national sovereignty. This Comment concludes that the safeguards in place in the founding treaties are flawed, but there are solutions available to improve the decision-making process in the sanctions regime.",

        "abstract": "The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is a U.S. regulation enacted for the primary purpose of combatting tax evasion and terrorism financing. FATCA attempts to achieve this objective by requiring the financial information of all individuals the Act defines as \u00bfU.S. persons\u00bf to be reported to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. While FATCA strives to abate financial criminality, it is mired with legal issues affecting U.S. law, the laws of foreign nations, and international law as a whole. This Comment argues that FATCA needs to be challenged in domestic courts of law and on the international stage. This Comment further argues that if FATCA does not face legal opposition, or is at least not given further scrutiny, it has the potential to end financial privacy and calls into question the traditional process by which a domestic law can become international law.",

The Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) can serve as a valuable tool to increase access to patented HIV medicines in developing countries if participation in the pool by patent holders can be increased. This Comment argues that governments in countries hardest hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic can increase participation in the MPP by collectively exercising TRIPS flexibilities and issue compulsory licenses for HIV medicines. Such a concerted effort by low- and middle-income countries to issue compulsory licenses could make the MPP more effective at increasing access to new and more affordable HIV medicines to respond to the treatment timebomb.",

To mitigate these burdens, this Comment proposes a Centralized Data Protection Agency to receive requests directly from citizens, weigh the privacy versus public interest rights, and make decisions that would be binding across all member states. This solution would make the request process easier for citizens, relieve private search engine companies from the daunting responsibility of determining legal privacy rights, and insulate member states from conflicting local implementation.",

Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, most of the Arctic\u00bfs resources and both currently-accessible Arctic shipping routes are exclusively controlled by the littoral Arctic states. Regional actors likewise dominate arctic governance, as non-Arctic states are denied speaking and voting privileges at the Arctic Council.

Consequently, a more inclusive, international approach to Arctic governance is necessary to address the challenges of a globalized Arctic.",

Since the International Criminal Court will likely be impeded by a Security Council veto, the concept of universal jurisdiction in its mitigated form may be the best option for prosecuting Syrian leaders responsible for the crimes committed under the jurisdictions of foreign states. The chances are high that post-conflict Syrian society would have great difficulty undertaking the legal trials of perpetrators of international core crimes in good faith.

The current system imposes strict territorial boundaries, inhibiting the armed intervention required to successfully combat terrorist organizations like ISIS. The United Nations Charter permits armed intervention in self-defense or collective self-defense and armed intervention sanctioned by the security counsel. However, Annalise Lekas argues neither mode allows States to defeat ISIS and instead, recommends that the Security Council, under its duty to maintain international peace and security, sets clear standards that allow States to combat ISIS with the force of law. First, armed intervention must be a last resort that is limited to threats involving a high severity and probability of mass atrocities. Second, armed intervention must serve a common interest\u00bfpreventing gross human rights violations and safeguarding international peace and security.",

Professor Rossi exposes internal tensions within the United Nations Charter system that threaten to further weaken the system and expose it to dangerous manipulations.

        "abstract": "Since the 1940s, there has been growing movement for the promotion of education. There is now an obligation in the international community to ensure that every child has the resources to exercise his or her right to education. Two problems have emerged from this obligation. First, international agreements define the right ambiguously but requires countries to adhere to strict and unrealistic deadlines. This has burdened developing countries. Second, there has been an increase in violent opposition groups targeting children to protest the promotion of education. To combat these problems, states should incorporate Gandhi\u00bfs philosophy. Gandhi advocated that education should be free but self-reliant, emphasize learning by doing and be based on indigenous culture. Tanzania implemented policies that were similar to Gandhi\u00bfs proposals and has been successful and ensuring access to education. This comment argues that the Tanzanian model may be a new approach to promoting the right to education.",

One such response is the \u00bfunwilling or unable\u00bf paradigm under which the armed forces of State A can take military action against terrorist groups located in State B if the government of State B is either unwilling or unable to prevent its territory from being to launch attacks. The paradigm has been used to justify airstrikes by the United States against al-Qaeda and ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria. Professor van der Vyver argues that the paradigm does not fit the conditions of self-defense under the U.N.

Possible international human rights violations associated with the country\u00bfs failure to provide redress to rape victims are also addressed. The Comment discusses venues outside of Pakistan through which victims could seek relief, including a transitional justice system or a domestic court system.

The Comment discusses the history of HIV/AIDS and the historical discrimination against homosexual men in the United States since states began enacting HIV-specific criminalization laws in the late 1980s. However, these laws fuel the stigma surrounding HIV and disparately impact gay men. Siobh\u00e1n Murillo explores the more appropriate solution: to create a new model criminal statute that criminalizes the transmission of HIV/AIDS but has stricter intent requirements, a higher level of scrutiny, a duty to disclose one\u00bfs HIV status, and has accompanying defenses, penalties, and remedies. This new model criminal statute could criminalize the intentional transmission of HIV but cause significantly less discrimination against gay men than current HIV criminal laws.",

        "abstract": "In this Comment, Jack W. Roberts discusses a recent push in Myanmar to expand compulsory free education through age sixteen amid recent discoveries that child labor in Myanmar may be even worse than originally believed. Jack considers the effect such an expansion might have on the nation\u00bfs child labor epidemic and possible approaches that might make this implementation more likely to succeed in curbing child labor. He considers the relatively recent expansions of compulsory education in other nations that have historically struggled with child labor\u00bfnamely China, Brazil, and India\u00bfin searching for examples of policies that have helped to make education expansion most effective in reducing the prevalence of child labor, as well as social, economic, and political factors that might complement such strategies. Ultimately, such a plan is more likely to succeed if Myanmar simultaneously takes steps to fight corruption in its political and educational system, makes a consistent showing of willingness to cooperate with nongovernmental organizations and trade unions, and takes steps to incentivize families to send their children to school. The Comment compares the characteristics inherent to these examples to the unique structures that exist in Myanmar, in hopes of illuminating approaches that may stem child labor in the country.",

Stuart Ford presents a new assessment utilizing complexity and efficiency. Ford\u00bfs work reveals that even the least complex trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is more complex than the average criminal trial in the United States, and that the trials completed by the ICTY thus far are the most complex set of related criminal cases to have ever been tried by any court. These conclusions highlight why it is misleading to compare the cost and length of the ICTY\u00bfs trials to other trials, both domestic and international, without first accounting for their complexity. Per efficiency, Ford concludes that the ICTY\u00bfs trials have proven more efficient than cases of comparable gravity and complexity tried in domestic courts or at the Special Court for Sierra Leone.",

While involving the local is a key to success in transitional justice interventions, in practice, the local is often overlooked or restricted by the global. Professor Sharp argues that understanding the global-local dilemma requires at least three things. First, we must understand why transitional justice became the focus for global-local tensions. Professor Sharp indentifies the Western historical and ideological origins of transitional justice as sources for global-local tensions. Second, we must understand local ownership. By describing the components of local ownership (actual control, process, and substance), Professor Sharp presents a more nuanced relationship between the global and local. Third, instead of discarding the concept of the local in favor of more complex theories, we must appreciate its interplay with the centralizing and universalizing tendencies of transitional justice.",

Outside the Alien Tort Statute, however, CIL authority in American courts remains unresolved and seemingly at odds with federalism. Debates are polarized between theories that CIL is binding domestic law and that CIL has no authority without enacting legislation. Seeking resolution, Katherine M. Davis assesses state and federal court decisions on CIL from fellow federal nations India and Australia. Indian and Australian jurisprudence offer three insights. First, as India and Australian courts harmoniously interpret CIL in various fashions, American solutions need not be as extreme as some suggest. Second, India\u00bfs and Australia\u00bfs limited embrace of CIL indicate that what many deem \u00bfAmerican exceptionalism\u00bf from international law may not be so exceptional after all\u00bfrather, a necessary function of federalism. Finally, drawing from an Indian state court, Davis suggests importing the CIL-equivalent of a Charming Betsy canon.",

In these nations, the issue is serious enough to force individuals to leave their homeland for another country. However, under the current regime of human rights law, these individuals are left without protection. While international conventions guarantee them the freedom of movement, they are not promised the right to enter other countries. Likewise, though refugee law covers sudden, violent, or extreme deprivations, it does not account for slow degradation of the environment, or social, political, or economic issues that lead to food scarcity. Under both approaches, vulnerable individuals are stranded without legal protection.

In Bangladesh\u00bfs pluralist legal environment of competing traditional and state venues, neoinstitutionalist-inspired development strategies overlook important factors and strategies that improve access to justice for those most hurt by crime. This study finds that crime victims who suffer greater economic harm resulting directly from the crime, as well as victims of violent crime, tend to engage the state criminal justice system rather exclusively utilizing the traditional system.

Ultimately, Cece sought refuge in the United States and applied for asylum. Returning to Albania meant returning to the threat of sex trafficking.

Unfortunately, the plaintiff may be unable to collect his or her judgment due to the strict standards of the Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgment Recognition Act (UFCMJRA). This catch-22 is reality for the Ecuadorian plaintiffs of Aguinda v. Texaco. In order to resolve such a predicament, Jungmoo Lee argues that instead of making drastic doctrinal or statutory changes in the application of forum non conveniens and foreign money judgment standards to deal with such a situation, U.S. courts should apply forum non conveniens dismissal on the condition that the case be moved to an international arbitration panel that is specifically tailored to handle the dispute at hand.",

        "abstract": "Since its passage in 1973 over the veto of then-President Nixon, the War Powers Resolution (WPR) has failed in its design to require notification and consultation to Congress by the President. Amidst emerging technologies such as drones, cyber tools, nanotechnology, and genomics, the ineffectiveness of the WPR will prove even more profound. As American presidents analyze the applicability of the WPR to military operations using these advancing technologies, they will have no reporting requirements because the WPR is not triggered. For the WPR to fulfill its original purpose, Congress must amend the statute to cover emerging technologies, expanding the coverage of the WPR from actions by armed forces to actions by armed forces personnel, supplies, or capabilities. This Article also proposes expanding the coverage of the statute to hostilities and violations of the sovereignty of other nations by the armed forces.",

The court answered in the affirmative and held that certain sections of Israel\u00bfs controversial security fence could not be built as planned. In these sections, the loss of human rights outweighed the security benefit of placing the fence through certain villages. Scholars focused on the court\u00bfs proportionality review, which was the seminal aspect of the case.

The international legal community\u00bfs acceptance of the changing world and the necessity of flexible ideologies should grow alongside our changing planet. Complaints disfavoring Sealand\u00bfs statehood claims range from its man-made nature, its lack of a recognizable citizenry, and England\u00bfs de jure ownership of the territorial sea in which Sealand resides. These complaints are backed by scholarship, and neighboring nations allege that various judicial opinions support their stance. Lyon agues, however, that recognition of Sealand\u00bfs sovereignty will inevitably come with the changing landscape of international law. This recognition could lead to future success for other man-made nations. The argument for Sealand is an argument for the adaptation of international legal norms, and the evolving international conception of \u00bfsovereignty.\u00bf",

        "abstract": "Intellectual property has influenced the recent extraordinary growth of the film and music industries in Nigeria. This growth, largely attributable to the introduction of digital technologies, has also been shaped by an intricate interplay between unbridled piracy and market-induced compliance with IP norms within the same industry. As a signatory of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, Nigeria is bound by IP protection standards applicable to both developed and emerging economies. In developing countries, this kind of legal harmonization often translates into a rigid enforcement of IP that risks stifling industrial production. Nigerian film and music industries, however, are thriving by incrementally transitioning from non-proprietary to IP-based regimes. Tracing this evolution, Rutschman contends that a combination of initial levels of low IP protection with progressive \u00bfformalization into IP\u00bf benefits developing industries that rely on digital production and distribution of content.",

To comply with international law, the United States should eliminate provisions directly regulating non-U.S. citizens\u00bf conduct outside the United States while simultaneously limiting the scope of prohibited conduct. Under international law, a state\u00bfs authority to impose sanctions is correlated to international law\u00bfs recognition of sovereignty. But legality is seldom tied to human rights. Bradley connects Executive Orders 13628 and 13645 and human rights concerns. Addressing these Orders, Bradley clarifies the meaning of \u00bfsanction\u00bf and focuses on the traditional principles establishing jurisdiction\u00bfnationality and territoriality. Because sovereignty and human rights are not mutually exclusive, Bradley argues these Orders are also illegal as over-inclusive. Bradley emphasizes the importance of contemporaneous sovereignty and human rights analyses, and explains why the United Nations is the better positioned to impose sanctions.",

Conflicting cryptos rules across borders are not necessarily a recipe for disaster. However, heavy-handed and cumbersome regulation will spark innovation to circumvent these controls and foster the development of new cryptos, reducing demand for the established cryptos and harming the international economy. Howden highlights how past suggestions for reconciling bitcoin to the purview of the International Monetary Fund were flawed. Ultimately, Howden examines ways in which the WTO, despite its flaws, can assert guidance for the crypto-currency industry; and why, given the current global entity structure, WTO regulation is the optimal available approach.",

The Rangers consistently spent more on players than the club\u00bfs payroll could afford. The Union of European Football Associations observed the problem and approved Financial Fair Play Regulations (FFP) to fix these financial issues. FFP intends to introduce rationality and stabilize the financial environment of European club football. The structure of FFP makes the regulation illegal under the European Union\u00bfs competition law. The predicted effect of FFP on the player market and competition between teams clearly violates EU competition law. Valerie Kaplan explores the manners in which FFP violates EU competition law, and offers a way for UEFA to achieve the objectives of FFP without further violations.",

        "abstract": "Indonesia\u00bfs role in international and regional affairs has increased markedly since the fall of Soeharto in 1998. It has, for example, signed many international treaties. However, Indonesian law is silent on the position of international law, whether treaty or custom, in Indonesia\u00bfs legal system. This has led to a significant unresolved legal debate about whether Indonesia follows monism or dualism. This Article argues that, while Indonesia appears to be dualist in practice, there is some evidence of monism, particularly in the decisions of Indonesia\u00bfs Constitutional and Supreme Courts. Regardless, the uncertainty has allowed the Indonesian government to, on the one hand, leave the international community to believe that ratified treaties have automatic application, but on the other hand, to refuse to grant any rights to citizens that those international treaties seek to provide, claiming that treaties have no domestic application until incorporated by an Indonesian legal instrument.",

        "abstract": "Res extra commercium is a doctrine introduced by Chief Justice Das of the Supreme Court of India in the 1957 case, State of Bombay v. R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala, which has the effect of constricting the scope of fundamental rights by rendering as constitutional outcasts certain purportedly immoral or noxious activities. It does this by blocking these activities from falling within the purview of the protection of fundamental rights. First, it will be argued that though the court did not expressly spell it out, it was the doctrine of police powers (the specific conception of the doctrine advanced by Justice Harlan of the U.S. Supreme Court in Mugler v. Kansas), which lies behind Chief Justice Das\u00bfs invocation of res extra commercium. Second, it will be argued that Chief Justice Das did not openly invoke the police power doctrine in R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala because larger benches of the Supreme Court had earlier squarely rejected the import of the doctrine from American constitutional law. Finally, the paper argues why the police power doctrine sought to be imported by Chief Justice Das under the verbal dressing of res extra commercium is incongruous with the scheme of the Indian Constitution.",

Conventionally, integration requires the amalgamation of political and economic policies. Yet, integration projects transcend political and economic cooperation and might even require harmonization of laws and principles. Scholars from legal, economic, and political sciences have studied and engaged in intra-disciplinary conceptualization of integration. Some of the theories that developed in relation to integration schemes in the developed North reflect socio-economic, political and historical factors of the North, casting doubt on the applicability, value, and consistency of those theories to integration schemes in southern Africa. Hence, this article is an attempt to conceptualize integration through a multidisciplinary analysis in order to proffer a broader conception of integration that encompasses local and regional emancipation movements in Africa in general, and in southern African countries in particular.",

        "abstract": "The Arab Spring sent shockwaves through the political landscape of the Middle East and North Africa and upended long-standing authoritarian regimes throughout the region in rapid succession. Among the many countries touched by the Arab Spring, Libya and Syria have been among the most profoundly impacted, experiencing institutional deficits that complicate efforts to resolve ongoing conflicts and now threaten regional stability. The effects of such instability also pose a threat to the international community. In order to transition from conflict to peace and sustainable development in Libya and Syria, however, international actors will need to make concerted efforts at rebuilding the architecture of governance, a process which entails restoration of rule of law, dispute resolution, and core government functions. Such a process necessarily entails engagement with the civil law systems in force in these countries. This Article, therefore, explores the structure and substance of the Libyan Civil Code and the Syrian Civil Code, with special attention given to two of the most critical aspects of civil law vis-\u00e0-vis post-conflict reconstruction: The way each civil code addresses the formation of obligations and the regulation of property rights. This Article explicates the formal rules that: (1) regulate the legal affairs of citizens in those countries; (2) notes the applicability of those laws to post-revolution problems; (3) explores those elements and aspects of the Libyan and Syrian civil codes which have made them such durable legal institutions; (4) and assesses their ongoing, post-revolution viability.",

Both cases are analyzed against the backdrop of U.S. constitutional theory and law. I begin by rejecting conceptualist approaches which focus on abstract concepts in order to assess the compatibility of religion, like Islam, with democracy. I show the futility of this kind of debate through a comparison to American debates between \u00bfliving constitutionalists\u00bf and \u00bforiginalists.\u00bf I then elaborate a pragmatic account that assesses the consequences of different institutional arrangements.",

Resources that seemingly should benefit African states have instead been the impetus for their stagnant development. Historically, the beneficiaries of these vast mineral deposits have not been the African populations but rather foreigners such as the colonial powers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, exploitative corporations during the post-WWII neocolonial era, and opportunistic military strongmen involved in Africa\u00bfs civil and crossborder wars. The revenue that these resource caches produce is more often than not funneled to external entities, such as an international corporation or a few elites within a state. This phenomenon is generally known as the Resource Curse.",

Instead, this Comment examines legal issues that are not classified as human rights violations but impact the Roma in ways that rise to the level of a human rights violation based on their unique background and culture. By focusing on the destruction of chattels and personal property, this Comment evaluates the effectiveness of legal claims for actions that may rise to the level of human rights violations in the unique cultural context of nomadic Romani life. Finally, this Comment concludes that there is a severe lack of adequate legal remedies available, and that current efforts have been insufficient to remedy the marginalization and mistreatment suffered by the Romani people.",

If blasphemy laws become customary international law, as recent resolutions passed in the United Nations indicate, an important human right is unnecessarily threatened. Though blasphemy laws protect the freedom of some individuals to practice religion as they see fit without insult or unjust attack, blasphemy laws also inherently limit other individuals\u00bf freedom of speech. The conversation over enacting and enforcing blasphemy laws is multi-layered and complex, but the foremost concern about certain new blasphemy laws is that they give freedom of religion undue precedence over freedom of speech, to the detriment of society. This Comment will illustrate the faulty thought processes behind blasphemy laws and the danger of allowing domestic blasphemy laws to evolve into international customary law.",

States remain the primary actors, but there has been a multiplication and intensification of the role of sub-state and non-state actors. There is a continuous transformation of international law, by both public and private mechanisms, from the national to the international sphere and vice versa. The evolution of norms has also become increasingly dense. Any discussion in this arena must contend with new sources and new subjects of international law.",

One field, \"Tamar,\" was the largest gas find in 2009 and the second, \"Leviathan,\" was among the largest strikes in a decade. NBL had undertaken the costly and risky explorations relying upon a long-existing regulatory structure which resulted in a modest royalty rate in addition to the ordinary corporate income tax rate. However, following the gas discoveries, the Israeli government amended the regulatory structure in 2011 with the enactment of a new windfall energy profits law which sharply increased the tax rate.

        "abstract": "Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles-more commonly known as drones-to target individual terrorists has become an important tool for U.S. counterterrorism efforts abroad. However, to use force abroad the United States must meet the requirements of international law, particularly the international law of self-defense. The United States has claimed that it is in an armed conflict with Al Qaeda and its associated forces, which would have to be conducted under the law of armed conflict. This Comment looks at a specific aspect of targeting\u00bfthe targeting of low-level members of terrorist organizations\u00bfunder the international law of self-defense and the international law of armed conflict. This Comment argues that while the international law of armed conflict would allow the United States to target low-level terrorists in an armed conflict, outside an armed conflict, the United States can only target low-level terrorists who constitute an imminent threat to the United States under the international law of self-defense.",

However, the growing atheist population, a religious pushback against secularism, and a neo-Federalist approach to the religion clauses in the Supreme Court could lead to the rights of atheists being restricted.",

Ali Mohamed Ali, that acts amounting to the intentional facilitation or incitement of piracy can constitute piracy in international law, and are subject to universal jurisdiction, even when those acts occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of a State. It argues that the decision has a sound basis in the orthodox rules of treaty interpretation. Although some have argued that universal jurisdiction can inhere over acts of piracy only where those acts of piracy occur beyond territorial jurisdiction, there is a strong legal and principled basis for the contrary conclusion. The decision invites a wider discussion of the limits of \"intentional facilitation,\" brief consideration of which suggests that the lack of a high seas requirement is likely to be expedient and unproblematic.",

One such revolution was the Libyan Civil War, which ended the forty-year reign of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. While the revolution certainly affected the lives of Libyans, it also left its mark on international criminal law. On February 26, 2011, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1970, which referred the situation in Libya to the International Criminal Court's Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) for an investigation into any international crimes committed by Muammar Gaddafi and his regime since February 15, 2011. As a result, the Pre-Trial Chamber (Chamber) of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued warrants for the arrest of Muammar Gaddafi, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi (Gaddafi), and Abdullah al-Senussi, alleging their responsibility for committing crimes against humanity during the conflict. The charges against Muammar Gaddafi were dropped due to his death, but the case against Saif Gaddafi and al-Senussi has continued and become an important issue for the new Libyan government, which has challenged the admissibility of the Gaddafi case before the ICC. The Chamber denied Libya's admissibility challenge on May 31, 2013.",

Angela could not talk and had \"neither the coordination or the mental faculties to be able to use sign language.\" She acted \"as a three month-old baby would.\" In her ninth year, Angela's menstrual periods commenced, and while her epilepsy was controlled by medication, seizures could occur when she had a heavy menstrual period. Excessive bleeding during these periods led to an \"Implanon\" medical procedure being performed, but this, together with oral contraceptive pills, proved to be unsatisfactory. The bleeding caused Angela to become anemic and experience other problems. Personal hygiene was also an issue. Medical advice, supported by at least three medical practitioners, proposed that a hysterectomy be performed on the child, leaving the ovaries and tubes intact to provide her with normal hormones. Therefore, \"only the source of bleeding would be removed.\" It was submitted that the effects on Angela would be relatively minimal and the menstrual problems would be resolved. As the nature of her disability was \"such that she would not have the psychological capabilities to consider a pregnancy into the future,\" this possibility would also have been taken care of.",

Indeed, even before 2000, numerous instruments of international law called for the abolition of sex trafficking. The problem was, none of them offered a definition of what was to be abolished. Thus, notwithstanding widespread agreement that something should be done about sex trafficking, there seemed to be little agreement on what, precisely, sex trafficking was.",

As such, when Judge Friendly called the Alien Tort Statute (\u00bfATS\u00bf) a \u00bflegal Lohengrin,\u00bf he was referencing the peculiar origin and nature of this aged statute. Although we are well aware of the origins of the ATS, its inactivity for almost 200 years clouded it in an aura of mystery. Now, almost thirty years after its revival by the Second Circuit, that same court may have stripped the ATS of its ability to defend its maiden, the victims of tortious actions attributable to corporate entities. The ATS has eluded much appellate review due to settlements and quick dismissals. The Supreme Court has seriously considered its jurisdictional grant in only one case. As such, there remains much mystery about its exact function and application. By requiring that courts look to the corpus of international law to determine jurisdiction, the ATS opens the door to judicial conjecture and confusion on the content of the \u00bflaw of nations.\u00bf Although the recognition of what constitutes substantive international law rules (such as standards for torture, extrajudicial killings, or forced exile) is a difficult enough task for the lower courts of the federal judiciary, the scope of those rules, such as their source, has equally led to conflict among the courts.",

        "abstract": "Two important legal reforms in court procedure have taken place in Brazil recently: s\u00famula vinculante (all courts now have to follow the reasoning of the Supreme Court in similar cases) and requisito da repercuss\u00e3o geral (the Supreme Court only hears cases that are of general importance). These two procedural rules respond to a long debate in the Brazilian legal community on how to address court congestion, the heavy workload of the Brazilian Supreme Court, and the role of the higher courts in establishing case law. We discuss the implications of these two important reforms from the comparative perspective (by explaining the similarities and differences with U.S. law, in particular stare decisis and the writ of certiorari) and from a law and economics approach (the likely consequences in terms of incentives for the Supreme Court, the court system, and the litigants more generally).",

Similarly, when China blocked The New York Times in late October 2012, in response to a story about the wealth of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, Herdict received several inaccessible reports from China for the news site. These events epitomize the importance of projects that track the openness of the Internet. But just as importantly, these events are data points in an experiment. Herdict is premised on the belief that by asking people to complete a small, simple task\u00bfreporting if they can access a site\u00bfwe can transform individuals into foot soldiers for Internet freedom, even if they do not see themselves as activists. Moreover, by making the task so small, these people can participate without assuming too much personal risk.",

In victory, Cielo thrust his fists into the air and repeatedly slammed them into the water, splashing with wild gesticulations. A half-minute later, he became more subdued and slid back into the water, hugging the lane line as tears welled in his eyes. After years of training and unwavering commitment to the sport of swimming, he had finally become the fastest swimmer in the world and an Olympic gold medalist. Three years later, while competing in Brazil two months before the 2011 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation (\u00bfFINA\u00bf) World Championships, Cielo found both his reputation and swimming future in jeopardy. At a Brazilian national swimming competition, Cielo and three of his teammates tested positive for the banned substance furosemide, a diuretic that can mask the presence of performance-enhancing drugs in a biological system. Under the World Anti-Doping Code (\u00bfWADC\u00bf), to which all swimmers who compete at the international level must adhere, Cielo faced up to a two-year period of ineligibility from the sport. Such a sanction would have prohibited him from competing in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London and potentially cost him millions of dollars in endorsement deals.",

Does its presence on public land constitute a violation of the First Amendment Establishment Clause? Would the answer change if the tiny parcel of land under the cross were transferred to a private party? If so, would the reasons why the government transferred the land matter?

The Constitution of the United States does no such thing. Nevertheless, from time to time, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken it upon itself to use international law as persuasive authority to interpret various provisions of the U.S. Constitution. Indeed, the Court has done so in very high profile cases such as Lawrence v. Texas, where the Court struck down a Texas anti-sodomy statute as an unconstitutional violation of due process. The high visibility of the cases in which the Court has called upon international law to determine the proper meaning of certain domestic constitutional provisions has brought a lot of attention to this practice. This Article proposes a method for the selection of international law within the framework of U.S. domestic constitutional interpretation.",

In the first instance, Grotius is important because he made a methodological leap in one form or another from a theological to a secular frame of jurisprudential thinking, and in so doing, characterized the dilemmas of governance in familiar terms to modernity. For other authors, the legacy of Grotius is not directly this shift from ecclesiastic to secular authority, but rather that his efforts are remembered to spark the political aspiration, implied to be at the core of international law itself, towards a more liberal tolerance of difference and a sentiment of restraint towards over-aggrandizing political agendas.",

        "abstract": "Until recent years, authorities in the United States gave little serious consideration to the marriage and family traditions of other religious groups. Courts today accommodate cultural and religious diversity more generously, but always within a larger framework of law requiring nondiscrimination, freedom of conscience, gender equality, and protections for dependent or vulnerable family members. In this context, although the unofficial family law of customary and religious authorities has important consequences for individuals and families, those authorities have not been able to enlist the coercive machinery of the state to enforce their orders. This type of pluralism, characteristic of the United States and Canada, poses significantly different questions than the pluralism of nations in which customary or religious law is backed by the authority of the state.",

Group rights are presently recognized as entitled to, if not a treatment equal to that of individual rights, at least the recognition of some form of legitimacy that justifies respect, consideration, and protection. Underlying such legitimacy is a view that looks to ensuring harmony between, and constructive coexistence of, the different components of democratic societies. This was not always the case with classic international law, which was not interested in the status and rights of groups, whatever their nature. The new approach tended to favor minorities that were more or less distinct from the majority of the respective populations, namely ethnic, religious, cultural, or linguistic groups.",

My general objectives are (1) to consider the legitimate and illegitimate ways in which African state and non-state actors seek to regulate religious practice; (2) to examine how particular religious groups may be disproportionately affected by these measures; (3) to demonstrate how interference with manifestations of religion often leads to abuses of related rights and freedoms (e.g. women\u00bfs and ethnic minorities\u00bf rights, and rights of political participation, expression, and association); (4) to broaden and update the concept of religious practice; and (5) to consider how the African examples of restrictions on and regulation of religious practice challenge Western assumptions about the nature of religion as an essentially private and internal affair.",

In accordance with the conflict of laws rules of many continental European legal systems, such as France and Germany, the courts of the host country apply the law of the parties\u00bf nationality (lex patriae) in matters relating to marriage and divorce. Under such regimes, Muslim parties involved in family law disputes may be subject to the law of their country of origin. This makes for striking results when applied to individuals who may have lived in a Western European country for decades but have not taken on the citizenship of that country, whether by choice or impossibility.

On the contrary, women-led hermeneutic communities all over the world are spearheading a silent but steady revolution that redefines women\u00bfs role as rights-bearing and equal individuals in familial and public space.

        "abstract": "The aftermath of a natural disaster unquestionably calls for action amid chaos. No matter its character\u00bfa sudden-onset earthquake, seasonal hurricane, or flooding\u00bfa natural disaster\u00bfs immediate-term impact is similar: families and communities confronting loss of life and property and struggling to meet their basic needs. The affected population may be displaced from their homes, supply chains of essential items such as food and fuel may be cut off, and social services may be interrupted. When these basic needs outstretch local capacities, the complexity of the response operation mounts. This Article highlights the importance of well-prepared domestic regulatory frameworks for effective disaster response. Reviewing several key historic and current international and regional initiatives, it offers insight into future directions in the field of international disaster response law.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, major natural disasters\u00bfranging from the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami to the 2010 Haiti earthquake\u00bfhave challenged the global community to ensure the survival and well-being of millions of individuals under the most difficult circumstances. Each of these natural disasters has created crisis spots with huge numbers of displaced persons, including high numbers of children. The international community has struggled to deliver the resources needed to ensure the prompt and full recovery of the affected populations. In these settings, the challenges confronting children are particularly acute. This Article examines the special circumstances facing children in post-disaster settings and the legal protections in place to ensure their rights and well-being.",

        "abstract": "In the summer of 2010, a controversy erupted after news surfaced of a planned mosque two blocks from New York City\u00bfs Ground Zero. The proposed location of the mosque, now named Park51, inflamed the passions of many Americans who believed that the Muslim institution would threaten both the memories of September 11, 2001, and the respect for those killed by the terrorist attacks. The Park51 mosque quickly attracted international attention, and the question of whether the state could restrict the mosque became entangled in a web of legal and \u00bfcultural sensitivity\u00bf arguments. This Comment advocates an international human rights framework to address the issue of whether the state can regulate religious land use, such as Park51.",

        "abstract": "In the spring of 2011, France enacted a law banning the concealment of the face in public spaces (the \u00bfburqa ban\u00bf). The burqa ban creates two new punishable offenses in France. First, wearing clothing designed to conceal one\u00bfs face in a public space is punishable by either a maximum of a \u20ac150 fine or by being required to take a class on the meaning of citizenship, or both. Second, forcing a woman to wear a face-covering veil is punishable by one year of imprisonment or a \u20ac30,000 fine. The burqa ban, which was first introduced by the French National Assembly and passed \u00bfoverwhelmingly\u00bf through both houses of the French Parliament, went into effect in France on April 11, 2011. While this Comment considers several factors, it argues that the burqa ban is an unjustifiable restriction upon the fundamental freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 9 of the European Convention.",

Soft Law and the Global Financial System not only describes the mechanisms of lawmaking and standard-setting for global financial markets, but also delivers a workable framework for prescribing and perhaps even perfecting the regulation of the world\u00bfs most vital and volatile economic institutions.",
