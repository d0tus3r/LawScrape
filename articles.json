In the intervening years, other examples of corporate misconduct have surfaced. Federal and State False Claims Act settlements with some of the world\u00bfs largest pharmaceutical manufacturers exposed facts demonstrating that through practices of misbranding and kickbacks, patients were given drugs for unapproved purposes or given drugs because of monetary inducement and not medical necessity. More recently, facts have surfaced indicating that one of the world\u00bfs largest automobile manufacturers concealed material flaws in its ignition system rendering numerous cars unsafe. In light of these events, the glaring need for a publication to explore the implications of corporate misconduct became apparent.",

Aguilar discusses corporate governance systems in a post-Great Recession world. By focusing on the perspective of an investor, Commissioner Aguilar analyzes topics including executive compensation, executive misconduct, say on pay, pay ratios, transparency, disclosure, shareholder voting, engagement of stockholders, and shareholder proposals. Utilizing real world examples, research, and his unique experience with the SEC, Commissioner Aguilar proposes changes to make companies more accountable to their stockholders and investors, creating a fairer corporate governance system and improving the system for all participants.",

        "abstract": "Over the last few years there has been a shift in the core ideas of business with respect to corporate responsibility. A new type of business classification called benefit corporations is gaining popularity in the United States. Benefit corporations are required to have a positive impact on society and the planet, and to meet a higher level of accountability and transparency. However, will benefit corporations truly change the industry and world positively? This article provides for skepticism about the positive affects benefit corporations are purported to have on business. One reason is that benefit corporations are completely voluntary; thus, the corporations in most need of change and oversight are not likely to opt-in. The motivation behind benefit corporations is a step in the right direction; however, in order to effect real change in corporate responsibility, the law needs to be bolder.",

Halliburton urged the court to overturn the landmark case Basic Inc. v. Levinson and in turn, the \u00bffraud-on-the-market\u00bf presumption. This piece argues in favor of denying Halliburton\u00bfs request and maintaining the presumption. First, Jonathan Massey argues that the congress should address this issue instead of the Court. If the Court does decide to take this issue, stare decisis should prevail. Furthermore, since Basic was decided in 1988, institutional investors have utilized passive investment strategies that rely on \u00bffraud-on-the-market\u00bf presumption. Finally, private and class action lawsuits act as a useful enforcement tools to prevent fraud where the SEC does not have resources to prosecute.",

        "abstract": "Changes to technology have greatly improved the way companies communicate. However, many states have yet to update their laws to allow for companies to take advantage of improving technology for formal corporate activities, including Board of Director actions. This is in contrast to stockholder meetings, where many states already allow for remote participation. If states uniformly update their laws to allow remote participation for Board of Director meetings, companies can run more efficiently and save money. Although there is a justifiable fear that a remotely participating director may not be as active a participant in the meeting, there is a system of checks and balances that stockholders can put in place to ensure directors uphold their duties to the company. If states do not enact laws expressly allowing for remote participation, they risk losing business to more technologically progressive states.",

In the late 1960s, the Second Circuit developed a set of tests, known as the \u00bfeffects\u00bf and \u00bfconduct\u00bf test, which allowed for extraterritorial enforcement of \u00a710b. In Morrison, the Supreme Court overturned the Second Circuit precedents establishing a new test. This essay looks at the history, current trends, and possible future developments extraterritoriality of securities enforcement. Specifically, John Koury examines whether \u00a778aa(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act could establish jurisdiction similar to the old \u00bfeffects\u00bf and \u00bfconduct\u00bf test.

        "abstract": "In 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (the \u00bfPLCAA\u00bf). This Act shields gun manufacturers from liability when its guns are used in the commission of a crime. Specifically, the gun manufacturer cannot be held financially liable when a third-party has misused the gun by injuring another. Historically, victims of gun violence have been permitted to bring civil cases against gun manufacturers when injured by a third-party. This Act has eliminated that option. Thus, victims and gun reform proponents must search for new options. In this article, Tiffany Taylor argues that by limiting the financial liability of gun manufacturers, the PLCAA interferes with natural product reform by substantially reducing a manufacturer\u00bfs incentive to participate in gun reform. Through careful analysis, this article explains how victims of gun violence must now fight for gun reform by manufacturers in the face of the PLCAA.",

Consequently, reformers have sought the implementation of laws to require public companies to obtain approval from shareholders, or, at the very least, disclose to shareholders all corporate political contributions. The most well known embodiment of the push for total shareholder disclosure of corporate political spending is the proposed federal act, the Shareholder Protection Act (SPA). The SPA aims to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, requiring public companies to annually disclose their corporate expenditures on political activities to their shareholders. In this article, Steven Zuckerman sets aside the constitutional issues with corporate political spending, focusing the discussion on the corporate governance concerns that support or oppose the implementation of the SPA.",

Amarin, in which courts held that the First Amendment protects pharmaceutical manufacturers who market their drugs off-label as long as the advertising is \u00bftruthful and non-misleading.\u00bf In so doing, these courts essentially overturned restrictions Congress imposed in 1962, after the thalidomide disaster. The drug at issue in Caronia is particularly dangerous\u00bfit is closely related to a date-rape drug, and was approved for a narrow indication. The defendant sales representative nonetheless said the drug was \u00bfvery safe\u00bf, and recommended it for a variety of common diseases, including Parkinson\u00bfs and insomnia. Today, however, the medical community requires rigorous evidence to determine the truth of any proposition. Yet these courts found the manufacturers\u00bf statements \u00bftruthful and non-misleading\u00bf without any evidence at all. Dr. Poplin concludes that decisions about drug advertising are best left to an independent expert agency, the FDA.",

Engelberg uncovers that these accounting scandals are the result of deeply held Japanese cultural beliefs about harmony and a deep respect for authority. These cultural beliefs cause Japanese corporate employees to follow their company\u00bfs CEO at all costs, even if it means fraudulently inflating company profits. Despite the passage of Japan\u00bfs first ever comprehensive corporate governance code, Engelberg argues little has been done to incentivize good corporate practices. Engelberg suggests the most effective to clean up Japanese corporate culture is to align employee incentives with the financial success of their corporate employers. This can be done by effectively tying executive compensation to company performance; strengthening current whistleblower laws; and creating clear enforcement procedures for companies caught of wrong-doing.",

The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has been shown to be the world\u00bfs leading tool in the fight against bribery and corruption. Any US company doing business outside the US is subject to the FCPA and must have an effective compliance program to be in compliance with the law. Yet this same law also protects US companies overseas in variety of ways, such as providing clear protections that US companies do business ethically and without resorting to bribery and corruption. The law also fosters US foreign policy, economic and legal interests abroad. FCPA enforcement and the compliance profession should not be eviscerated by the incoming administration as it is not in either the US government\u00bfs nor US business\u00bfs interest to do so.",

But now under Trump, unions will face a conservative supreme court likely to rule against unions. Unions will also face a Republican Senate and Congress looking to pass anti-labor legislation.

She also argues that the health insurance market has inherently changed and that any future approaches will need to consider changes such as increase early screening and increased life expectancy with chronic illness.",

        "abstract": "Software-as-a-service equity management platforms (\u00bfEMPs\u00bf) have emerged in recent years to simplify and streamline the issuance and management of securities for private companies and their lawyers by taking documents and processes previously reliant on paper and making them electronic. By allowing users to electronically issue, sign, and manage stock certificates, options, and other convertible securities, EMPs can save time for lawyers/paralegals and reduce legal costs for clients. EMPs provide various other benefits as well, including automated compliance checks, pro forma financing and exit scenario modeling, and inexpensive 409A valuations. However, despite the cost-savings and other benefits to using electronic equity management platforms, there are also new risks in using these platforms, such as data loss, data breach, and lack of data access. Overall, if the risks are properly managed and the cost structure makes sense, EMPs can be a smart choice for companies and lawyers looking for greater efficiency, convenience, and lower costs in the issuance and management of securities.",

The latest draft of the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law outlines the oversight role for the Board of Directors to ensure that there are adequate cybersecurity policies, technical staff, and annual reports provided to the Board. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have, late last year, released a Joint Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for enhanced cyber risk management standards that reinforces the concept of Board Governance for Cybersecurity programs, oversight and reporting. We intend to present these Board governance requirements, their breath and the different approaches taken by each regulator, which all reinforce the common theme: the oversight responsibility of Corporate Boards of Directors for Cybersecurity.",

        "abstract": "In many countries, including the United States, governments have implemented regulations that aim to encourage expenditure on research and development (\u00bfR&D\u00bf). Often, the regulations used to encourage R&D can have the effect of stifling innovation. This is because the tax incentives available for R&D disproportionately benefit large multinational enterprises (\u00bfMNEs\u00bf) and do little to benefit startups and small businesses. As a result of the disparate benefits received from R&D-related regulations, startups and small businesses, which often have very innovative and cutting-edge ideas, are unable to compete with large MNEs. Because of this inability to compete, innovative ideas are left unrealized. In the United States specifically, MNEs benefit much more from the R&D tax credit than startups and small businesses do, and this disparity results in an unlevel playing field. The U.S. Government has taken a step in the right direction through the changes made in the PATH Act in 2015, but there is still room for improvement. The implementation of a well thought-out IP box regime could significantly improve the ability of startups and small businesses to compete with MNEs.",

We will review what standards are currently being utilized by both the prudential regulators, the CFPB, as well as the New York Department of Financial Services, and the best practices that those in the commercial banking and consumer lending spaces should implement including review of the FFIEC's Cyber Security tool. After our discussion of compliance on the front end, we will close with best practices to implement in the event of a breach and how the best practices put place prior to the breach will help in limiting your regulatory, reputational and litigation liability post breach.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the proliferation of online crowdfunding sites and projects, Zachary Fialkow decided to look deeper into how law intersects with this particular type of innovation. What Filakow found was a revolutionary set of ideas hampered by legislative and judicial hangups. For example, equity crowdfunding, whereby small-time investors can buy equity in burgeoning companies, can bring power to people in a way previously unheard of. However, the same laws permitting equity crowdfunding in the U.S. are also preventing it from being truly useful, involving unfavorable funding limits and complex regulations. In addition, rewards-based crowdfuning, of Kickstarter and Indiegogo fame, are simpler to use and less regulated, but also leave open great vulnerabilities to fraud. In fact, unlike equity crowdfuning, rewards-based crowdfunding could use more governmental regulation. Fialkow argues that balancing this need for consumer protection with the need for businesses to operate freely is key to ensuring online crowdfunding\u00bfs viability in the future.",

This paper initially explores the history of the FCC\u00bfs internet regulations, including the legislation and court rulings which changed the scope of the FCC\u00bfs authority. Net neutrality, which is the principle that all lawful internet content should be treated equally by internet service providers, is contextualized and justified using several modern examples of net neutrality violations. Next, the history of net neutrality is recounted, so that the differing views that FCC regulators have had on the scope and content of internet regulations can be better understood. After that, Chairman Pai\u00bfs disagreements with other FCC commissioners are analyzed, because disagreements among commissioners might foreshadow changes in policy.",

Unfortunately, many of these transactions never reach that stage. In an effort to understand these multifaceted deals, Adrian Szycowski analyzes one of the many factors in a M&A deal. Using state statutes, case opinions, law journal articles, law firm client alerts, and other sources, Szycowski examines the interplay of jurisdictional default rules with common contract provisions found in every M&A deal. After setting a brief foundation of mergers and acquisitions, Szycowski reviews how Delaware, New York, and California approach and treat sandbagging, waiver of jury trial, and non-compete provisions. He also puts forward several alternative theories to help explain the discrepancy in the approaches of the aforementioned jurisdictions. Ultimately, Szycowski finds that Delaware and New York are generally pro-buyer jurisdictions while California is pro-seller/pro-worker.",

Over the next century, Congress would pass many laws in furtherance of this goal. As the Congress would pass these laws, the Court would be pressed to review the constitutionality of these bans. What developed was a constant back-and-forth between these two branches, one passing laws and the other striking down. If the fear of corporate involvement leading to corruption in the government is well-grounded, because the Court struck down the ban on corporate expenditures the ball is back in the court of the Congress to make the next move. In Citizens United v. FEC, the Court held unconstitutional laws that banned corporations from making independent expenditures. This Essay explores a possible next move the Congress could take in removing corporate money from federal elections.",

        "abstract": "This year, Emory University School of Law celebrates its Centennial Year. As Emory Law celebrates a century of advancing the rule of law it also celebrates one hundred years of advancing society. Indeed, the two primary engines of societal progress are the laws that protect humanity and the innovations that enhance it as a whole. Yet, innovation and law are often at odds due to the nature of these concepts. This Issue of ECGAR provided specific examples of how regulations stifle innovation. Although finding the perfect balance between the blistering speed of innovation and the slow advance of law may be difficult, an administrative state that answers innovation with only more regulation can provide no answer at all.",

I spent years representing industrial and service unions and their members; the average working person\u00bfor hardcore union member\u00bfhas no allusions about the power of institutions to corrupt. They often view their own employer and their union with the same gimlet eye. Yet, my litigation against the healthcare industry has, at the very least, been a policy laboratory for the understanding of institutional wrongdoing and deficiencies in compliance enforcement. While the lessons I have learned are in the first instance about \u00bffraud, waste and abuse,\u00bf in the delivery of healthcare, they are transferrable and thus have meaning elsewhere.",

The Essay focuses on the pharmaceutical companies, but device companies are subject to the same regulations. In fact, in 2015, the Department of Justice filed charges, including claims for putting misbranded and adulterated products in interstate commerce, against two Acclarent executives, William Facteau and Patrick Fabian, for the promotion of a device approved as a sinus spacer for unapproved use as a steroid delivery system. As this Essay makes clear, legislative efforts to allow broader off-label marketing are short-sighted, ignoring both the terrible consequences visited on patients prior to the Kefauver-Harris Amendments.",

We blame corporations for catastrophic environmental events, misbranded drugs that cause injury, and financial products that destroy the life savings of those who have toiled for a living; yet at the helm of the corporations\u00bfguiding their path of impropriety\u00bfare people, many of whom who have benefited handsomely from the corporate misconduct that they have captained.

As ads end with this depiction of relational bliss through drug use, viewers hear a fast-paced listing of monotone non-segmented disclaimers, which can range from modest impacts (e.g., slight weight gain) to very serious implications (e.g., suicidal ideations). Research suggests that hearing about the risks of use may increase consumers\u00bf trust in the advertising. Sufferers may also conclude that stronger means better (i.e., helping them more effectively manage their condition). When it comes to health, consumers tend to mitigate the risk of taking drugs.
