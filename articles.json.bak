        "abstract": "Contemporary politics is characterized by a polarized national discourse, weak party organizations, volatile control of government, and an increasingly assertive executive. These political dynamics interact with a system of administrative law inherited from different political times that is ill-suited to addressing the risks of the current moment, which include threats to administrative values such as efficiency, impartiality, and expertise; to democratic values such as accountability, transparency, and participation; and, most generally, to the ability of the law to benefit social well-being through sound policymaking. In recent years, some legal scholars have become attuned to the interaction between administration and these features of the political environment. Unfortunately, administrative law itself has been slow to catch up, with potentially dangerous consequences for the stable functioning of the U.S. administrative state. Drawing from the political science literature that examines the interacting features of organized politics that generate stable party systems, we examine how prior administrative law regimes have responded to political transformations in the past. With this research in view, we find that administrative law as it stands today, which emerged during an earlier party system, is ill-suited to meet the challenges of modern politics. Time will tell whether courts will shape doctrine to better align administrative law with the needs of the times.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/69/1/farahany.pdf",
        "abstract": "The neuroscience revolution poses profound challenges to the doctrine of avoidable consequences in tort law and exposes deep theoretical riddles about the right to our own mental experiences and memories. To address this profound question, this Article begins with a deceptively simple principle of tort law: A victim of tortious wrongdoing by another is held responsible for mitigating her own physical injuries. This Article addresses whether that same doctrine should require a tort victim to likewise mitigate her emotional injuries. The answer to that question is of great and increasing importance because it goes to the heart of how society should address dramatic advances in neuroscience that enable us to change our own minds. This Article proposes a revolutionary way to understand both the answer to this question and to bring daylight to many puzzling doctrines in law\u2014through the right to cognitive liberty. Through an introduction to the groundbreaking concept of cognitive liberty, the confusion plaguing the doctrine of avoidable consequences in tort law for emotional distress injuries is solved and new insights are developed with respect to other doctrines in law. These implications are as far-ranging as the deliberative privilege afforded to judges to the forced competency of prisoners. It quickly becomes apparent that cognitive liberty is the interest upon which many of our most cherished freedoms are secured.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/69/1/okelley.pdf",
        "abstract": "Social media platforms like Facebook are increasingly the arbiters of what political viewpoints get the light of day. As more people become active on social media, including using it as a primary news source, and as political speech increasingly moves onto these platforms, they will continue amassing the power to control news narratives, the size of speakers\u2019 bullhorns, and the ideas that get discussed. Moreover, these platforms will likely face increasing external pressures to silence certain viewpoints deemed objectionable or offensive, whatever those views may be. The United States Constitution provides no check on this power. As private actors, social media platforms can ban whatever speech they want, and for whatever reason, subject only to market pressures. Simply, the First Amendment, based on its text and longstanding precedent, does not apply. There may be another way to safeguard speech online, however. This Comment proposes looking to a different source of law, one all too often overlooked in litigation and scholarship: state constitutions. Nearly all state constitutions have free speech clauses that are textually different from the First Amendment in ways suggesting state action requirements can be softened or even jettisoned. Moreover, a handful of states have interpreted their free speech clauses as being broader than the First Amendment and applying to certain private actors\u2014an approach with express approval by a unanimous United States Supreme Court. This case law provides reasoning applicable to a new and modern dilemma: the gravitation of political speech to social media platforms.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/69/1/hall.pdf",
        "abstract": "Coal ash ponds pose a significant threat to the environment and human health. Coal ash is a byproduct of the electricity production process, and it contains carcinogens like boron, arsenic, lithium, and mercury. Typically, utility companies store coal ash in ponds located near rivers and lakes. If coal ash is stored in ponds that lack an adequate liner, the coal ash can seep into the groundwater and travel to nearby surface waters, which may serve as a drinking water source for neighboring communities. The EPA has admitted that the majority of America\u2019s coal ash ponds are unlined and prone to leaks. Moreover, there have been several instances where coal ash ponds have failed and discharged millions of gallons of coal ash into surrounding surface waters. In an effort to protect citizens\u2019 health and the environment, plaintiffs have utilized the Clean Water Act to hold utilities liable when they discharge coal ash pollutants to surface waters via hydrologically connected groundwater. Nevertheless, the Fourth Circuit in Sierra Club v. Virginia Electric and Power Co. determined that coal ash ponds were not point sources under the CWA, and this decision will likely prevent future plaintiffs from bringing claims against utilities under the Act. The holding in Sierra Club will also limit future plaintiffs\u2019 ability to hold polluters liable for unpermitted discharges from other types of \u201ccontainers,\u201d which will increase the possibility of an environmental disaster. As a result, the Supreme Court must step in and reverse the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision. More specifically, the Supreme Court must hold that coal ash ponds are point sources under the CWA. To reach this decision, the Supreme Court must first look to the purpose of the CWA, which was designed \u201cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\u2019s waters.\u201d Then, the Supreme Court must look to the language of the Act, specifically the CWA\u2019s definition of the term \u201cpoint source.\u201d Lastly, the Supreme Court must look to other cases involving \u201ccontainers\u201d as they indicate that \u201cnatural processes\u201d may be part of a point source discharge if the polluter \u201cinitially collected\u201d the pollutants.",

        "abstract": "In 2017, Congress passed major tax legislation at warp speed. After enactment, it fell to the Treasury Department to write regulations clarifying and implementing the new law. To assure democratic legitimacy in making regulations, administrative law provides that an agency must issue a notice of proposed rulemaking, followed by an opportunity for the public to comment (so-called \u201cnotice and comment\u201d). But, after the 2017 tax overhaul, many sophisticated actors did not wait until the issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking to comment, instead going to the Treasury Department immediately with comments designed to influence the regulations. In this Article, we examine empirically this phenomenon of post-enactment commenting by studying the making of the Internal Revenue Code Section 199A regulations\u2014some of the most important regulations implementing the 2017 tax reform. We examined the inputs into the regulatory process from legislative enactment through the regulations\u2019 finalization. We find extensive engagement by sophisticated parties and industry groups prior to the official notice-and-comment period, which helped shape and anchor rulemaking outcomes. Subsequent comments submitted in the official notice-and-comment period led to technical and other discrete changes but did not fundamentally change the initial rulemaking approach. Throughout the rulemaking process, there was little direct, public-interested engagement.",

        "abstract": "Juveniles should hold the right to a jury trial under the U.S. Constitution, but they do not. In most states, when a trial occurs, a single judge determines whether a youth loses their liberty, and that imprisonment can last for years. The United States Supreme Court has decided that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury is irrelevant; prosecution in juvenile court is not a criminal prosecution within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment because the purpose of the juvenile courts is a good one\u2014to rehabilitate youth. The Court has also held that the right to a jury trial is not required under the due process clause because juries are not essential to factfinding. By exploring the unexamined meaning of criminal prosecution in the Sixth Amendment, rejecting the Supreme Court\u2019s use of the state\u2019s good purpose, and probing the neglected historical right to a jury trial for juveniles, this Article challenges the common assumption that juveniles do not hold the right to a jury trial.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/69/2/parker.pdf",
        "abstract": "Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code grants an exemption from federal income taxes to organizations that are formed for religious purposes. While religious tax exemptions are a deep-rooted principle long embodied in U.S. tax law, issues can arise when a tax-exempt institution engages in discrimination which conflicts with national public policy. The most famous example of this is the case of Bob Jones University v. United States, in which the Supreme Court revoked the tax-exempt status of a religious university for its racially discriminatory policies. The Court found that, because the government had expressed a unified opposition to race discrimination in education for a number of years, an institution that engaged in such discrimination conflicted with national public policy, such that it should not receive tax-exempt status. Now, in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges, advocates for both religious freedom and LGBT rights are questioning whether this \u201cpublic policy doctrine\u201d could now apply to discrimination based on marital status, or even sexual orientation in general. However, legal scholars have shown that such an application of the doctrine may be problematic when implemented outside of race discrimination.",

One of this Comment\u2019s overarching goals is to reflect on how Gault\u2019s central premise\u2014that children are entitled to constitutional rights\u2014can be more meaningfully achieved. Recognizing that its proposals are broad in scope, this Comment offers two possible rationales that could support adoption of its suggestions. With reference to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent Eighth Amendment jurisprudence and to its cases that interpreted Miranda\u2019s provisions, this Comment offers examples of how the Court\u2019s existing precedent may allow the Court to adopt a heightened constitutional standard to protect children\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.",

        "abstract": "The tender offer is a common method used by third parties to gain control of a company. Third parties will approach a company\u2019s shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares at a fixed price, the result being a change in ownership and control. A company\u2019s top executives may be threatened by this change in ownership and want to recommend that the shareholders reject the offer.

This may lead to a conflict between the shareholders\u2019 interests and the executives\u2019 interests. Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to ensure that tender offers are not alienated by these conflicts of interests faced by company executives, and to ensure that shareholders are given all accurate information material to the decision of whether to accept or reject the tender offer.

One of these gaps concerns the process behind the present-value analysis required by Section 1325, which states that debtors must pay creditors the present value of their claims over the course of the debtor\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. This process implicitly dictated that debtors must pay a discount rate to properly compensate their creditors. Because Congress never indicated how this discount rate should be calculated, bankruptcy courts created several different solutions to the problem. This left the bankruptcy system in a state of chaos as the rules varied substantially from district to district.

Yet, images of refugee professionals working underpaid jobs are becoming more common in news and other areas of daily American life such that your Uber driver could be a human rights attorney and your school\u00bfs janitor might be a civil engineer. The freedom of refugees to practice their professions is severely undermined by a panoply of state and federal laws and policies, which make it difficult for refugee professionals to re-credential. To de facto protect these refugees\u00bf right of professional practice, this Comment proposes a national standard of treatment and credential recognition regulations that will give refugees a more meaningful opportunity for re-credentialing.",

Law enforcement cannot locate anonymous Dark Net users without hacking into their computers, which requires a search warrant. Yet police cannot apply for a warrant without first knowing the computer\u00bfs location, because a judge does not have the authority to issue a warrant that will be executed outside her jurisdiction. A judge cannot determine whether she has jurisdiction to issue a warrant when the location to be searched is undiscoverable without the very warrant itself. This Comment analyzes Fourth Amendment implications of searching unknown locations and recommends expanding statutory authority and procedural mechanisms to allow courts to issue warrants when the location to be searched is unknowable. This would further the constitutional preference for warrants without violating constitutional principles governing territorial limitations on courts\u00bf jurisdiction.",

First, the Court ignored the differences between how public markets price risk and how private parties\u00bfparticularly financial sponsors\u00bfprice risk. Second, the Court took the well-supported evidence of information efficiency in securities markets as necessarily implying a high degree of value efficiency. It then compounded this error by attributing this value efficiency not simply to the securities market but also to the deal market. Third, the Court succumbed to a flawed analogy between the fiduciary duty and appraisal contexts, implying that conditions of pricing efficiency are met whenever directors satisfy their minimum fiduciary obligations. Fourth, the Court treated company valuation as a mechanical calculation, downplaying the role of human judgment. This Article analyzes these errors and considers some implications for the future.",

This comes after several jurisdictions have lost key initial public offerings to other jurisdictions, resulting in a myriad of responses from stock exchanges, stock indices, and government bodies. As a result of the significant change in regulatory landscape, this Comment considers how the United States should respond. In turn, this Comment offers a framework to offset the extremes on both sides of the debate. The proposed solution balances minimal safeguards that protect shareholders from the most egregious failings of the dual-class structure while safeguarding founders\u00bf vision for the future of their companies.",

Later that year, the DOL issued a final rule, known as the fiduciary rule, that aimed to prevent conflicted investment advice and consequent losses. But after nearly two years of an uncertain fate, the rule was vacated by the Fifth Circuit in March 2018. While the SEC is currently finalizing a rule that could fill the void created by the DOL\u00bfs fiduciary rule being vacated, the details of that rule remain unknown.

        "abstract": "In 2015, the FCC preempted statutes in North Carolina and Tennessee that limited the powers of municipally owned internet service providers to expand their networks to nearby underserved communities. The FCC determined, pursuant to Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, that these state limits on municipal broadband networks were anticompetitive barriers to infrastructure investment. The States appealed the FCC order, arguing that the FCC did not have the authority to interpose itself between the States and their political subdivisions. Relying on the Supreme Court\u00bfs earlier decision in Nixon v. Missouri Municipal League, the Sixth Circuit agreed with the States. This Comment argues that the Sixth Circuit should have applied a narrower reading of the clear statement rule, which would strike an appropriate balance between the FCC\u00bfs unmistakably clear authority to regulate the deployment of broadband technology against the legitimate sovereign interests of the affected states.",

This consensus is codified in the Federal Rules of Evidence, which forbids the use of most \u00bfpropensity evidence\u00bf at trial. Defenders of the ban suggest, without empirical proof, that jurors would overvalue the probative worth of propensity evidence and that the public would balk at such evidence as a matter of legal procedure. Using insights from social psychology, this Article reports the results of three original experiments, which examine the conditions under which the public might legitimize verdicts that rely on propensity evidence. These experiments, which surveyed over 1,200 participants, suggest that propensity evidence is a legitimate form of trial proof and that jurors are more competent to evaluate such evidence than policymakers believe.",

First, it argues that there is no Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause barrier to national personal jurisdiction. Second, it argues that Congress has the power to introduce national personal jurisdiction as to all claims brought in the federal courts, but that Congress lacks authority to introduce national personal jurisdiction as to any claims brought in the state courts. However, Congress could open the federal courthouse doors wider to claims where national personal jurisdiction is deemed appropriate. Third, this Article considers what steps Congress can use to implement national personal jurisdiction.",

In response, the League has taken a page from the tobacco industry playbook by employing the same strategies used during decades of litigation surrounding the health consequences of smoking cigarettes. Accordingly, this Comment explores the utility of using Big Tobacco as a predictive template for future NFL/CTE litigation by unpacking the historical parallels and distinctions between these two industry giants, especially as pertains to an assumption of risk defense. Ultimately, this comparative analysis informs litigation strategy by outlining the unique pressures and structures faced by NFL plaintiffs such that they should overcome an assumption of risk defense. While their circumstances are fundamentally different, NFL athletes face the same institutional complicity and orchestrated denial as did tobacco users, only this time, all of America has a Sunday ticket.",

However, the Prequalification Programme faces two glaring shortfalls.

Second, nearly all of the prequalified drugs have been produced in middle- and high-income countries, rather than the low-income countries most in need.

Neither patent nor copyright provide the same leeway even though these remedies raise the same potential problems in both contexts. This Article explains why this arrangement is backwards given the greater notice failures, inexhaustibility, and importance of cumulative production for intellectual works relative to tangible property. Just as lawmakers reshaped real property law to accommodate the demands of industrial production, lawmakers should recalibrate IP law to serve the needs of intellectual production. Possibilities include a \u00bfreasonable search defense\u00bf to limit relief against infringers who operated in good faith and the adoption of compulsory licenses to deal with holdout strategies and advance other major policy objectives.",

In recent years, patent misuse doctrine has essentially gone the way of antitrust\u00bfnarrowing its focus to a thin sliver of anticompetitive harms. Copyright misuse doctrine, however, has remained attentive to broader intellectual property policy concerns. Courts have, for example, responded to misuse arguments where a copyright owner\u00bfs licensing or enforcement behavior threatens to deter innovative activity or socially valuable speech. Although trade secret owners engage in similar practices, courts have not developed an analogous trade secret misuse doctrine.

        "abstract": "Many people are familiar with the convenience of booking a cheap weekend stay using Airbnb, VRBO, and similar home-sharing sites. But as this practice becomes more widespread, short-term rentals of fewer than thirty days are contributing to a growing number of negative externalities: Cities such as Los Angeles and New York are battling with the conversion of properties into rogue hotels that slip underneath regulation, which has led to rising rents and a shortage of affordable housing. On a smaller scale, residential communities are being pestered by a steady rotation of disruptive guests. This Comment argues that the popular common-interest community model is well-suited to regulate damaging short-term rentals. With careful planning, these communities can implement tailored and enforceable restrictions on rentals. As a stopgap, however, courts should interpret \u00bfresidential use\u00bf requirements to prohibit short-term-rental activity that most closely resembles a business.",

Today, new constitutional liberties and new reforms to family law and criminal law have dramatically reduced the roll of sex crimes and the roles of churches in maintaining sexuality morality. But sexual misconduct remains a perennial reality in modern societies, including notably within churches, and sex crimes inflict some of the deepest scars on their victims. Modern liberal states must thus maintain a basic standard of sexual morality in its criminal law as a restraint on harmful behavior and as a bulwark against a sexual state of nature where life is often \u00bfbrutish, nasty, and short\u00bf for the most vulnerable. And liberal societies should encourage its citizens and churches to pursue a higher morality of aspiration that views sex and the sexual body as a special gift for oneself and others.",

It seeks stricter legal prohibitions on \u00bfobscene\u00bf materials, even when viewed in private homes, and greater enforcement of existing laws. History demonstrates that these proposals are unsound for three reasons. First, \u00bfobscene\u00bf pornography is difficult to define without violating the First Amendment. Second, Prohibition demonstrates the difficulties of laws depriving citizens of goods that they desire on moral grounds they do not share. Censorship of online pornography would present similar problems. Third, any broader definition of obscenity would be inconsistent with basic First Amendment principles and a dangerous precedent for other restrictions on currently protected expression. Enforcing such a sweeping suppression on what even adults may watch in the privacy of their homes would be radically inconsistent with our liberal democracy.",

        "abstract": "In response to the changing face of child pornography and the harms associated with it, Congress enacted the PROTECT Act. Despite this effort to protect children\u00bfs images online, there remains much to be done. First, the Supreme Court must uphold the PROTECT Act, finding morphed child pornography outside the scope of the First Amendment. Second, states must amend their statutory definitions of child pornography to encompass morphed child pornography. Lastly, parents must be cognizant of the risks associated with oversharing pictures, as online images can be stolen and then used for illicit purposes such as morphing. These cogent paths forward can offer meaningful legal and social benefits to victims and potential victims of child sexual abuse and to children who suffer violations of their online privacy.",

        "abstract": "This Article explores the relationship between free speech and harm. Examining the historical First Amendment justifications, it argues that harm is a relevant criterion in determining the scope of speech protection. But this Article also resists the notion that speech should be restricted solely based upon resultant damage, demonstrating instead that the freedom to speak freely actually forestalls rather than causes individual and societal harm. Drawing upon psychological and sociological theories related to the treatment of sex offenders, the Article posits that the ability to engage in free expression is critical to preventing physical and emotional damage to others. Individuals who have the ability to speak freely about their emotions, opinions, and identities are less likely to engage in rebellion, aggression, and crime. In this way, free speech provides a therapeutic alternative to harmful behavior. These therapeutic qualities of expression provide a justification for protecting rather than silencing it.",

        "abstract": "Recent partisan gerrymandering litigation has relied heavily on statistical metrics to identify constitutional violations. If this trend continues, quantitative analysis could become the crux of constitutional analysis. This Article describes how constitutional law founded on numerical thresholds transforms judicial decision-making and undermines rights enforcement. Courts enforce constitutional law to ensure governmental compliance with rights founded in moral principles, not to advance alternative policy arrangements. Yet if quantitative outcomes are used to define rights, courts act as quasi-regulatory entities that compete with democratically elected branches. Arguably the most condemned decision of the twentieth century, Lochner, reflected such a quasi-regulatory approach to rights enforcement; excessive reliance on statistics threatens to repeat that mistake. Courts should approach the problem of partisan gerrymandering using a principle-based approach, and identify constitutional violations when legislatures seize partisan advantage in democratic process.",

        "abstract": "The landscape of public education, once thought to be a core function of the state, is shifting towards privatization with the expansion of vouchers and tax credits that use public dollars to fund private school tuition. This Article focuses on the impacts of such programs on students with disabilities. It argues that voucher legislation, as applied to students with disabilities, violates two principles of constitutional law: the unconstitutional conditions doctrine and equal protection. The unconstitutional conditions doctrine limits government\u00bfs authority to require individuals to forgo their rights in exchange for a gratuitous benefit. Vouchers cross those limits, coercing students into accepting a restriction of significant rights to escape failing public schools. Voucher programs, motivated by a desire to eliminate the costs and burdens associated with educating students with disabilities, stumble into an equal protection problem because they target students with disabilities for disadvantage without sufficient justification.",

Ivy Tech Community College, became the first U.S. circuit court to hold that Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against individuals in employment on the basis of sexual orientation. Given that many federal antidiscrimination statutes are interpreted in line with Title VII, the Hively decision may extend sexual orientation discrimination protections to a variety of areas. However, since the Supreme Court\u00bfs decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby now allows private businesses to seek religious exemptions under RFRA, it is possible that private businesses might seek to avoid complying with Title VII\u00bfs sex discrimination prohibition on the basis of religious objection. This Comment examines the relationship between Title VII and RFRA and argues that expanding the Hively court\u00bfs interpretation of Title VII is the most promising method for protecting against sexual orientation discrimination nationwide.",

        "abstract": "In Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer, the Supreme Court determined that a state could not deny a church generally available benefits because of its religious character. Before Trinity Lutheran, the Supreme Court consistently recognized the existence of a \u00bfplay in the joints\u00bf between the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause, meaning some state government actions are neither prohibited by the Establishment Clause nor required by the Free Exercise Clause. Issues concerning tax exemptions and state funding are consistently held to fall within the \u00bfplay in the joints,\u00bf which permits state and local governments to refuse to fund religious institutions, even if funding would be constitutionally permissible. This Comment argues that the Trinity Lutheran decision is problematic and Locke v.

These arguments demonstrate that a streamlined and adaptable state legal system for emergency response is one that (1) provides a governor with the authority to issue one type of emergency declaration, (2) does not divide vital authorities across various declaration types, and (3) provides a governor with the unilateral power to remove statutory and regulatory barriers to an effective response.",

        "abstract": "This Symposium Article explores the origins and limits of the federal government\u00bfs interstate quarantine power. In the event of a public health emergency, state and local political boundaries may generate self-interested measures that risk substantial harm to neighboring states. To more effectively stem a national epidemic and to better protect the interests of regional populations, should the federal government step in to override a state\u00bfs protective quarantine? Neither current statutory authority nor how we have thought about it in the past prevents a greater national role. This Article shows how to expand our view of the federal government\u00bfs interstate quarantine authority as an important tool to respond to public health threats affecting more than one state.",

        "abstract": "Our electoral system is vulnerable to terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and other calamities that can render polling places inaccessible, trigger mass evacuations, or disrupt governmental operations to the point that conducting an election becomes impracticable. Many states lack \u00bfelection emergency\u00bf laws that empower officials to adequately respond to these crises. As a result, courts are frequently called upon to adjudicate the consequences of election emergencies as a matter of constitutional law, often applying vague, subjective, ad hoc standards in rushed, politically charged proceedings. This Article examines the legal steps various government actors took in response to terrorist attacks and natural disasters that disrupted impending or ongoing elections throughout the early twenty-first century, including the September 11 attacks on New York City, Hurricane Katrina\u00bfs destruction of New Orleans, Hurricane Sandy\u00bfs devastation of New Jersey and New York, and Hurricane Matthew\u00bfs impact along the southeastern United States. It then analyzes the constitutional issues that such election emergencies raise.",

But in doing so, it has failed to appropriately distinguish among differently situated taxpayers with offshore holdings. Second, the United States has focused on revenue and enforcement, paying less attention to the significant compliance costs and potential social harms that its initiatives create.",

This Comment anticipates that the Act will face free speech challenges that may find the GE labeling law unconstitutional, especially following recent trends in First Amendment jurisprudence that have been increasingly applying stricter scrutiny upon constitutional review. Due to inconsistent applications of the two governing tests that review compelled commercial speech\u00bfthe Central Hudson and Zauderer standards, respectively\u00bfthis Comment suggests that the Supreme Court, in the context of the GE labeling law, determine the appropriate scrutiny level that courts should apply when reviewing First Amendment cases involving compelled commercial speech.

This Comment puts to the side the issue of whether such bias actually exists and instead focuses on the perception that these biases exist, arguing that systemic changes are needed to address the appearance of injustice they cause. The perception of bias degrades the appearance of justice to the public and police alike, endangering the legitimacy of the legal system; for that reason, we ought to presumptively disqualify local prosecutors from handling cases involving police-suspects.

Scholars have proposed new approaches on subject matter eligibility, urging courts to revisit and revitalize other areas of the patentability analysis: utility and the written description requirement. While these arguments adeptly characterize some solutions to the current predicament, they do so without utilizing the full armament available to them. This Comment proposes that by instead viewing the problems with modern jurisprudence as a misunderstanding in the realm of philosophy of science, the lens provided by Thomas Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions clarifies such arguments against the Supreme Court\u00bfs \u00bfinventive step\u00bf analysis.",

With little fanfare, it has abandoned its decades-long effort to divide electricity regulation into mutually exclusive spheres of federal and state authority. Instead it has embraced a more sophisticated concurrent jurisdiction model\u00bfagainst the wishes of Justice Scalia, who opposed this transformation in his final published dissent. This Article explores the ramifications of this revolution, particularly for state energy regulators. The shift to concurrent jurisdiction is long overdue. The historic model of the local vertically integrated utility has long been replaced by regional, complex, innovative electricity markets. Concurrent jurisdiction allows regulators to adapt more nimbly to changing market dynamics, unrestrained by the outdated formalism of the old dual federalism model.",

In several states, based on perceptions of a medical malpractice liability and insurance crisis, reformers have sought to abolish tort liability for medical malpractice\u00bfreplacing it with an administrative compensation system not based on negligence and roughly similar to workers\u00bf compensation. Surprisingly, it turns out that workers\u00bf-comp-like administrative systems, though more radical than damages caps and similar reforms, seem to have a better chance of being held constitutional\u00bfin part because of their similarities with workers\u00bf comp, which also abolished certain tort actions and replaced them with a non-negligence-based administrative system, and which has been universally held to be constitutional. This Article analyzes the constitutionality of this sort of administrative compensation system under the Florida, Alabama, and Georgia constitutions, focusing on jury trial rights, access-to-courts rights, and due process/equal protection.",

        "abstract": "In 2008, the United States suffered its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. This crisis was precipitated by corporate fraud committed by some of the largest Wall Street firms. Congress responded by passing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank) to improve accountability and transparency in the financial system. Recognizing the importance of whistleblowers in exposing corporate fraud, Congress included an anti-retaliation provision in Dodd-Frank, which was designed to protect whistleblowers from retaliation after coming forward with evidence of corporate wrongdoings. This Comment surveys existing case law to highlight how the SEC may still extend Dodd-Frank anti-retaliation protection to internal whistleblowers while conforming to Chevron and the recent Supreme Court ruling. The SEC can accomplish this by exempting internal whistleblowers from disclosing to the SEC. Ultimately, this Comment argues that the SEC can advance Dodd-Frank\u00bfs goals of expanding whistleblower protections by exercising its forgotten general exemptive authority to protect internal whistleblowers, even if Dodd-Frank\u00bfs text clearly requires disclosure to the SEC.",

As a short Essay meant to provoke rather than to answer questions, the piece is necessarily cursory in its treatment of historical causation, controversies, and patterns. First, I outline the relationship between gender and vulnerability in the liberal welfare regime, premised on concepts of feminine vulnerability and masculine independence. Second, I discuss the ways in which the neoliberal welfare regime assumes invulnerability: it valorizes sex neutrality, while reinforcing private responsibility for dependency. Third, I use vulnerability theory to help illuminate a historical path not taken: the transformation of the welfare regime according to the model of the universal, interdependent caregiver rather than the universal, autonomous breadwinner.

        "abstract": "This Essay reflects on Professor Fineman\u00bfs generative scholarship by revisiting my engagement with her work over the years. Such revisiting is, in a sense, an intellectual autobiography, since I trace the shifting areas of concern in my scholarship and the role of various formative influences upon it. Often those influences were in evident, but productive, tension, such as with feminism and liberalism. In this revisiting, I also observe some critical shifts in Fineman\u00bfs own scholarly projects, such as from dependency to vulnerability and from a gender lens to a skepticism about a focus on identities. Another formative influence I discuss in this Essay is Fineman\u00bfs enormously generative contribution to the development of scholarship by creating spaces for sharing and critiquing scholarship, through the FLT Project and, more recently, the Vulnerability and the Human Condition Initiative.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/67/6/thomson.pdf",
        "abstract": "Mainstream bioethics has long been challenged for its focus on the technological developments of biomedicine and principles of individual ethics. It is argued that the focus on these particular objects, and the delisting of the social context within which the ethical is constructed and experienced, limits the extent to which bioethics provides a contesting counter-weight to modern biomedicine. In response, this Article promotes Martha Fineman\u00bfs vulnerability theory as a new framework for bioethical deliberation. Fineman\u00bfs foundational concern with the embodied and embedded experience of being human puts the social at the heart of analytical enquiry. Further, a focus on the institutional structures within which we are all embedded provides a framework for assessing state responsiveness to its embedded citizens. Recognizing that mainstream bioethics has historically resisted the incorporation of other frameworks, this Article argues that the current turn to the social in the life sciences provides an important new context within which we might successfully reimagine bioethics and its objects of ethical concern.",

        "abstract": "The Convention Against Torture prohibits the exclusion or removal of any foreign national who is likely to be tortured upon returning to his homeland, without exception. In the United States, this absolute rule is the law of the land. Such universal applicability exists nowhere else in American immigration law, and for aliens convicted of serious crimes, its significance is difficult to overstate. But those seeking relief under the Convention are unlikely to receive it. At the center of this troubling state of affairs is the plenary power doctrine, the extra-constitutional foundation upon which American immigration law rests. For the political branches, the doctrine is a wellspring of extensive and unparalleled authority; for the courts, it is a short leash of subdued and toothless deference. After establishing that the extraordinary degree of deference usually required by the plenary power doctrine is unwarranted when protection is sought under the Convention Against Torture, this Comment proposes an alternative standard of review for cases where such relief has been denied as a result of adverse credibility determinations.",

        "abstract": "Although some scholars argue that prohibiting deficiency judgments will lead to increased strategic default by borrowers who still have the financial resources to make their monthly payments, several recent studies discount this hypothesis.

        "abstract": "The recent amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were the most controversial in decades. Many feared that the amendments would undermine the simplified, merits-driven approach that the original drafters of the Federal Rules envisioned and would weaken access to justice and the enforcement of substantive rights and obligations. This Article argues that the amendments do not mandate a more restrictive approach to pleading or discovery. The final amendments\u00bfin light of their text, structure, and advisory committee notes\u00bfshould be interpreted to preserve notice pleading and a robust discovery process. The more significant lesson of the 2015 amendments, therefore, may be to confirm that the amendment mechanism is unlikely to generate consequential changes to the Federal Rules. Accordingly, the key battleground following the 2015 amendments will be in the federal courts themselves, as judges are called upon to interpret and apply the rules in particular cases.",

These strategic decisions show that the Supreme Court may need to rethink the level of discretion or deference granted to the judges in certain doctrines such as qualified immunity. In Pearson v. Callahan, the Court granted judges confronting novel civil-rights claims maximalist discretion whether to decide constitutional questions for the public\u00bfs benefit. What the Court forgot, however, is that discretion can also have unintended consequences. This Article addresses perhaps the most serious of these unintended consequences: strategic behavior by judges. While the Court recognizes that federal agencies may have incentives to use discretion in strategic ways, neither the Justices nor scholars have considered the strategic considerations influencing a judge\u00bfs discretionary decision to clearly establish constitutional rights.",

Despite the \u00bfjudicial\u00bf qualifier, absolute judicial immunity has been extended to a number of parties who are not judges. Although language in Supreme Court opinions certainly supports restricting absolute judicial immunity, this Comment proposes that the Supreme Court\u00bfs muddled methodology in this area supports the expansion of absolute judicial immunity.

A split between two district courts exists regarding whether personal jurisdiction in these cases is constitutional after the Supreme Court\u00bfs 2014 decision in Daimler AG v. Bauman. This Comment explores the application of personal jurisdiction under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and argues that Daimler should not be applied to cases brought under the Anti-Terrorism Act.

        "abstract": "In recent years, federal government agencies have increasingly attempted to use plain language in written communications with the public. In the tax context, rather than achieving simplicity, which would involve reform of the underlying law, the use of plain language to describe complex legal rules and regulations often yields \u00bfsimplexity.\u00bf As we define it, simplexity occurs when the government presents clear and simple explanations of the law without highlighting its underlying complexity or reducing this complexity through formal legal changes. Having introduced the concept of simplexity to the legal literature, we show how the IRS\u00bfs use of simplexity poses a trade-off between representing the tax law accurately and making it understandable to the public. We offer approaches for preserving some of the benefits of simplexity while also responding to some of its drawbacks. We also forecast the likely emergence of simplexity in potential future tax compliance measures.",

        "abstract": "This Article argues that copyright is an increasingly significant cause of anticommons concerns in the software context for at least two related reasons. First, the increasingly collaborative nature of much modern software innovation means that any given software resource is subject to dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of distinct copyright interests. While collaborative innovation licensing models help reduce the threat, these licensing models do not altogether eliminate such risks. Second, interoperability needs in the growing \u00bfInternet of Things\u00bf and \u00bfcloud\u00bf economies demand sharing and reuse of software for these ecosystems to work. Yet because these technological ecosystems implicate thousands of different parties with distinct copyright interests, the threat of those parties using its rights looms large. As a possible solution to these types of problems, this Article assesses the merits of more explicitly adapting copyright\u00bfs fair use defense to the collaborative and interconnected nature of modern software innovation.",

To date, scholars and policymakers have focused primarily on whether and how the government should regulate the sharing economy\u00bfthat is, on what form, if any, regulation should take. This Article focuses on a logically antecedent question\u00bfwho should decide. Using the potentially significant, yet uncertain, environmental impacts of Uber and Lyft as a case study, this Article argues that regulatory authority should be allocated according to the principle of precautionary federalism. Precautionary federalism embodies a default presumption in favor of multiple regulatory voices, and against broad exercises of preemption under such conditions. And precautionary federalism is time-bound\u00bfit acknowledges that greater certainty about impacts may warrant a shift from one allocation of authority to another. This precautionary approach can serve an information-forcing function about the significance of uncertain impacts.",

Electronic devices have even invaded a controversial area of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence: the private search doctrine.

Courts sought to fill this gap using two primary approaches: the container approach and the particularity approach. The container approach ignores the modern realities of electronic devices and the related privacy concerns.

        "abstract": "This Comment argues that federal courts and the FTC should narrowly construe a recent Supreme Court decision restricting the scope of the antitrust state-action doctrine. In North Carolina State Board of Dental Examiners, the Supreme Court held that state boards controlled by active market participants must receive active state supervision to invoke state-action antitrust immunity. Notably, the majority opinion did not provide a test for determining whether active market participants control a state agency. Nor did it offer guidance on the adequate level of supervision states must provide to satisfy the active supervision requirement. States and courts can look to an FTC Staff Guidance Statement and the Parker together to suggest that N.C. Dental is amenable to an interpretation that does not eviscerate the antitrust state-action doctrine. What\u00bfs more, strong policy reasons support an interpretation of N.C.

Of course, states conducted economic espionage before the Internet, but the availability of cyber exploitation rapidly and significantly expanded the activity. But today, traditional state-sponsored surveillance and espionage have been transformed into high-tech and high-stakes enterprises. Some of the cyber activity is electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, mimics traditional spying, and services a range of what most of us would concede are legitimate national security objectives. However, a good deal of the cyber sleuthing involves economic matters, and is undertaken by states or their proxies to secure comparative economic advantage.",

The beeper gave way to the flip phone, which has largely been replaced by the \u00bfsmartphone,\u00bf a mini-computer that fits in the palm of your hand and is more powerful than the desktop machine of the 1980s. Paper maps are increasingly rare, replaced by built-in Global Positioning System (GPS) devices or the ubiquitous smartphone. These and other technologies, which are valuable to civilians and law enforcement alike, also enable a granular view of citizens\u00bf movements and associations in public over long periods of time at a relatively cheap cost. Where law enforcement is involved, these powerful new technologies also raise questions about how their use can be harmonized with the U.S. Constitution.",

        "abstract": "Law enforcement access to personal data presents a paradox at the heart of debates between the European Union (EU) and the United States (U.S.) about privacy protections. On the one hand, the comprehensive privacy regime in the EU contains many requirements that do not apply in the United States. On the other hand, the United States also sets requirements that do not exist in the EU. Thus, both are stricter in important ways when setting standards for law enforcement access to personal data. The fact that both sides are stricter in significant respects is important to two distinct topics: how to reform the system of Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA), and whether the United States provides \u00bfadequate\u00bf protection for personal data under EU law. The relative strictness of standards for law enforcement access is central to understanding current obstacles to reforming the MLA system.",

This Article then turns to a discussion of the role that implicit racial bias may have in school officials\u00bf decisions to rely on intense surveillance.

        "abstract": "With the surge in online shopping, use tax has become an increasingly elusive source of tax revenue for states. The constitutional constraints of due process and the Commerce Clause establish limits that often frustrate states\u00bf attempts to impose tax collection obligations on remote retailers. In Quill, the Court held that a state could only impose a collection obligation on a retailer that was physically present in the taxing state. This Comment analyzes post-Quill cases that exemplify the absurdity of treating local retailers differently from remote retailers that economically exploit the same market. The Comment then considers, and ultimately rejects, four alternative mechanisms that have been proposed by scholars. The Comment concludes by proposing a novel solution, which shifts the burden of use tax collection away from remote retailers and onto the consumer, allowing states to circumvent the Commerce Clause obstacle altogether.",

A franchise model provides a ready-made approach that considers fraternity structure and operation and finds liability when the requisite relationship and control exist. Accordingly, this Comment analyzes how fraternities are franchise arrangements and demonstrates the ready-made approach a franchise model provides by applying franchise liability to a fraternity using recent Maine cases.",

The America Invents Act (AIA) of 2011 created new administrative proceedings at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that replace certain aspects of district court patent litigation. This Comment examines the relevant statutory provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act and AIA and explores the scenarios that give rise to uncertainty about the thirty-month stay. It argues that the thirty-month stay should terminate when the Federal Circuit affirms the USPTO\u00bfs unpatentability determination and issues the formal mandate. Because neither the FDA nor courts are likely to construe the relevant statutory provisions to this effect, this Comment proposes an amendment to incorporate AIA proceedings into the Hatch-Watchman framework.",

We also find evidence that casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that arbitrators render \u00bfsplit the baby\u00bf decisions. Although direct comparisons are difficult, we find that arbitrators generally perform at least as well as, but never demonstrably worse than, national judges. There may be reasons to prefer judges to international arbitrators, but the quality of judgment and decisionmaking, is not one of them. Thus, normative debates about global dispute resolution should focus not on decisionmaker identity or title but rather on structural safeguards and legal protections to enhance quality rule of law based decisionmaking.",

Schools have instituted stricter policies without considering the due process rights of the accused. Problematically, the statements made by the accused, under limited due process safeguards, can be used in criminal proceedings. This Comment pays particular attention to the lack of safeguards present in the college disciplinary process for adjudicating sexual misconduct. This Comment argues that it is unconstitutional to admit in a state criminal proceeding statements that were made by students accused of sexual assault in a college disciplinary hearing.

Application of judicial estoppel in this context is both inequitable and contrary to provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Instead, defendants who seek to assert judicial estoppel against an undisclosed lawsuit must first petition the bankruptcy court to reopen the debtor\u00bfs bankruptcy case to request relief from the automatic stay. The bankruptcy court may then appoint a trustee who can either abandon the claim or pursue the claim for the creditors.

First, it argues that there is a state interest to create a process to remove civil legal disabilities triggered by a conviction. Second, this Article argues that reintegrating people with convictions back into society is consistent with the state\u00bfs interest in punishment and public safety. Third, it critiques current state experiments. Finally, it argues that the state should destigmatize a person with a conviction. To do so effectively, the state must incorporate reintegration approaches throughout the criminal justice system. The Reintegrative State envisions a holistic framework for helping those with criminal records re-assimilate into society.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/66/6/schacknow.pdf",
        "abstract": "Third-party litigation funding is an emerging industry that provides financial backing to plaintiffs. Typically, third-party litigation funders provide money in exchange for a percentage of damage returns. To decide whether a given plaintiff\u00bfs claim is a good investment, the third-party litigation funder assesses the claim\u00bfs merits by conducting due diligence over a large swath of documents. Often, these documents are protected by attorney\u00bfclient privilege. Under normal waiver rules for attorney\u00bfclient privilege, when privileged documents are disclosed to a third party, the privilege holder impliedly waives the privilege protection. Consequently, third-party litigation funders deserve the same protection (afforded to insurers and re-insurers) offered by the common interest doctrine. Recognizing the common interest doctrine to protect documents disclosed to insurers and third-party litigation funders effectuates the policy goal of attorney\u00bfclient privilege; it enables litigants to most effectively obtain legal counsel.",

        "abstract": "This Comment takes a common-sense approach in arguing for the regulability of coordinated issue advocacy. This approach appeals to the experience of most Americans today, who frequently encounter campaign advertisements during elections. To bolster the common-sense approach, this Comment reviews instances of political scandal related to issue advocacy, such as those involving Senator Alan Cranston and Senator Robert Menendez. It also analyzes the federal courts\u00bf limited ventures into defining regulable campaign speech, which reinforce the government\u00bfs interest in regulating coordination. This Comment further analogizes to other areas of law, such as bribery and anti-gratuity regulations, to better understand the policy concerns underlying regulable conduct by politicians. This Comment concludes that coordinated issue advocacy should be regulable. Coordination alone is enough to lead to corruptive influence or its appearance, regardless of a communication\u00bfs content.",

        "abstract": "The need for institutional reform to address the problem of sexual assault, particularly on college campuses, is widely acknowledged. In the midst of increasing moves on campus to codify affirmative consent standards (\u00bfyes means yes\u00bf), rape law remains mired in an archaic view of consent as rather beside the point. This Article recasts the significance of law\u00bfs preoccupation with force by introducing a taxonomy of cases in which force and non-consent tend to diverge. The no-force/no-consent cases raise a question critical to ongoing reform efforts: does the absence of consent make sex rape? Outside of law, this inquiry has for the most part been resolved; what remains is to reconcile competing interpretations of consent\u00bfs meaning. In stark contrast, the criminal justice system\u00bfs treatment of nonstranger rape reflects a doctrine woefully out of step with modern conceptions of sex. Sexual agency provides the theoretical underpinning needed to close this gap.",

        "abstract": "Recently, members of the Supreme Court have signaled a willingness to reconsider, and perhaps jettison, Seminole Rock. Seminole Rock has been widely accepted but surprisingly disconnected from any analysis of its origins and justifications. This Article\u00bfthe first historical explication of Seminole Rock deference\u00bfargues that Seminole Rock cannot support the theoretical weight that subsequent courts and evolving administrative law doctrines have complacently put upon it. Seminole Rock was the product of its time\u00bfthe 1940s, an era of war-time price controls and a new age of administrative law. Later cases wrongly divorced Seminole Rock from that context. This Article documents the untethering of Seminole Rock. It shows how, in the 1960s and 1970s, alongside an expanding administrative state, the doctrine transformed into a more mechanical and highly deferential form of agency deference. In doing so, this Article provides new depth to the emerging critiques of Seminole Rock deference and lends critical support for reexamination of the doctrine.",

In particular, it analyzes whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must provide homeowners with due process\u00bfnamely notice and an opportunity to be heard\u00bfwhen they initiate nonjudicial foreclosures. Application of the state action tests from Lebron and Brentwood Academy most persuasively suggest that nonjudicial foreclosures initiated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must satisfy due process requirements. Ultimately, this Comment concludes that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are state actors under the entwinement test. However, because courts are reluctant to find state action where the government regulates the secondary mortgage market, it remains unlikely that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will be required to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard to homeowners facing nonjudicial foreclosure.",

These defendants argue that by offering their understanding of complete relief to a plaintiff, the claim should be mooted. In the past four decades, a circuit split has arisen over whether Rule 68 offers can moot claims and whether judgment should be entered for the plaintiff or the defendant. This Comment advocates for the adoption of the Ninth Circuit\u00bfs holding in Diaz v.

After all, the Free Speech Clause prohibits the \u00bfabridging of freedom of speech.\u00bf The question for this Article is not whether public accommodation laws violate the Free Speech Clause but whether they even trigger free speech review.

        "abstract": "The broad tension between rule-like categorical approaches and standard-like balancing approaches to doctrinal design has been a longstanding issue within First Amendment jurisprudence. This Article focuses on one particular dimension of this broad theoretical question: the idea of doctrinal transparency. When doctrine is transparent, it encourages or forces courts to analyze cases openly, in a fashion that elicits direct discussion of foundational speech value and speech harm issues. Such transparency is particularly valuable within the First Amendment context, where difficult or novel questions of speech value and harm are often avoided or distorted by doctrinal formalities and empty sloganeering. Through this lens of doctrinal transparency, this Article analyzes two distinct areas of First Amendment doctrine touched upon in recent Supreme Court cases: the historical test for low-value speech set forth in United States v. Stevens and its progeny, and the longstanding default rule that strict scrutiny applies to content-based speech restrictions that underlay the Court\u00bfs decisions last Term in Williams-Yulee v.

The basic idea of this Article is that it is hardly clear that respect for an agent\u00bfs autonomy ought to lead other agents, or the state, to tolerate autonomous communicative actions that are determined to be likely to cause harm to third parties any more than they should tolerate autonomous non-communicative actions whose consequences are equivalent. If the principle of freedom to engage in autonomous actions is one that is limited to cases of harm to others, then, at the very least, this limitation has more impact on standard autonomy views about freedom of speech than has commonly been appreciated. If there is a reason to protect autonomous speech that does not apply as well to autonomous action, then it cannot be a reason derived from the idea of autonomy itself, and instead needs to be based on a much greater empirical showing of the differential consequences of speech and action than has to date been provided.",

The Article argues that five categories of laws are inherently suspect under the Free Speech Clause and should be treated as such.

In several cases\u00bfsuch as those dealing with government employee speech, civil defamation, and fraud\u00bfthe Court continues to rely on balancing approaches. This has created a seeming internal contradiction among precedents that appear only to recognize the constitutionality of content-based restrictions on low-value categories of speech that have historically and traditionally been unprotected. These two lines of cases can and should be reconciled for the sake of adjudicative predictability and stability. The Court\u00bfs categorical free speech doctrine should be understood as a bar only against ad hoc balancing, but not as a total prohibition against a contextual analysis of expressive and countervailing social interests.",

This Article analyzes why\u00bfcontrary to a longstanding historical trend\u00bfpersonal liability may be on the decline, and whether agencies and prosecutors should be doing more. The analysis confronts fundamental policy questions concerning changing corporate and social norms. The public and the media perceive the crisis\u00bfs harm as a \u00bfwrong\u00bf caused by excessive risk-taking. But that view can be too simplistic, ignoring the reality that firms must take greater risks to try to innovate and create value in the increasingly competitive and complex global economy. This Article examines how law should control that risk-taking and internalize its costs without impeding broader economic progress, focusing on two key elements of that inquiry: the extent to which corporate risk-taking should be regarded as excessive, and the extent to which personal liability should be used to control that excessive risk-taking.",

Through the first three years, inter partes review has been widely utilized, while covered business method patent review has received considerable attention as well. However, the PTAB has created a procedural tool not explicitly included in either the statutes or regulations. The issue with this procedural tool is the costly estoppel effects it could have on the petitioner in the event of an unfavorable decision either at the PTAB or Federal Circuit level. This Comment suggests two potential solutions: (1) the PTAB could conditionally institute proceedings on all grounds it agrees show a reasonable likelihood of success, have the petitioner choose what it thinks are the strongest grounds for unpatentability, and continue the proceeding based on those grounds; or (2) interpret the statute so that determinations of redundancy are appealable to the Federal Circuit, allowing the petitioner to subsequently assert those grounds of unpatentability if it can demonstrate that they are not redundant.",

        "abstract": "Overbroad laws trespass on First Amendment rights of expression. Overbroad coercion statutes, which prohibit communication limiting a listener\u00bfs legitimate options, exist in a variety of states and municipalities. By failing to narrowly prohibit unlawful coercive speech, these overbroad statutes criminalize a broad range of protected First Amendment speech. These statutes can be particularly problematic for political actors because they can criminalize political bargains and discussion characteristic of the American political system. As the crime control model has grown, state prosecutors\u00bf charging power and discretion have vastly increased. This Comment argues for a judicial and legislative response to this problem and explains why legislators and judges should have a strong interest in invalidating and narrowing these overbroad coercion statutes. Ultimately, this Comment proposes a framework through which judges should invalidate these statutes and describes why legislators have a duty both to the Constitution and to themselves to proactively narrow these statutes to avoid overbreadth.",

        "abstract": "People are marvelously inventive in devising new ways to hurt each other. Some of these new ways involve speech. The Supreme Court has recently declared that speech is protected by the First Amendment unless it is a type of communication that has traditionally been unprotected. If this is the law, then harms will accumulate and the law will be helpless to remedy them. Revenge pornography prohibitions raise a serious free speech problem. They suppress truthful information, and they do so in order to prevent audiences from being persuaded, by that information, to form a viewpoint with which government disagrees: specifically, that this woman is a despicable whore because she allowed this picture to be taken. The harm that this speech causes is, however, so severe that an exception to ordinary free speech principles is justified.",

This Article provides a novel analysis of how to make progress on energy and climate change issues by translating this emerging psychological research into a framework for action. It proposes two interconnected strategies\u00bf substantive and structural\u00bffor moving past imbedded partisanship and political dysfunction. Substantively, the Article argues for refocusing regulatory efforts on areas where a greater degree of consensus may be possible, such as economic development and disaster resilience. Structurally, it proposes a shift to arenas that are less gridlocked by energy partisanship than the legislative branch of the federal government, such as other branches of the federal government, state and local levels, and corporate and private sector actors. By drawing on case studies and empirical data, including interviews with key stakeholders, the Article illustrates possibilities for progress under this framework.",

        "abstract": "The collapse of the residential housing market in 2007 brought with it a wave of foreclosures. Subprime borrowers, who were once elated by loans they secured from lenders, suddenly found themselves strangled by the predatory terms of their newfound loans and ultimately became unable to pay their outstanding loan balance. This Comment analyzes the different circumstances under which lenders can foster the creation of zombie mortgages. Particularly, this Comment focuses on stalled and incomplete residential foreclosure sales and failures to execute deeds of sale, tactics which serve to maintain legal liability of the mortgaged property on a borrower. Notwithstanding a lender\u00bfs right to foreclose on residential property to satisfy the obligations that it is owed under a promissory note, this Comment argues that strategic delays in completing a foreclosure sale entitle state courts and legislatures to either (1) force a lender to complete a sale or (2) divest a lender from both its right to foreclose and its security interest.",

        "abstract": "Catastrophic oil spills are some of the most visible and devastating contemporary environmental disasters. Unfortunately, a loophole in the Clean Water Act has significant potential to limit the United States\u00bfs ability to prosecute those who spill oil. This Comment argues that the application of statutory preclusion to Oil Pollution Act cases is contrary to the original intent of the Congress in drafting the statutory preclusion provision of the Clean Water Act and subsequent Oil Pollution Act amendments. Further, applying statutory preclusion to oil pollution cases undermines effective enforcement. This Comment proposes that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should take a leadership role by arguing that its interpretation of the statutory preclusion provision in its regulations should be entitled to deference under Chevron v. National Resource Defense Council. Providing Chevron deference to the EPA\u00bfs prosecutorial determinations will resolve a three-way split among the federal circuits. A uniform rule will also facilitate effective relationships under cooperative federalism for the benefit of the environment.",

        "abstract": "The Federal Circuit\u00bfs dismissal of Consumer Watchdog\u00bfs appeal in 2014 illustrates a systemic shortcoming of standing in patent law. More specifically, the current implementation of the federal standing doctrine in patent litigation prevents public interest organizations from litigating the validity of patents. This shortcoming appears in spite of the fact that the patent system exists as a public endorsement of a private right in exchange for a purported social contribution on the part of the inventor and her invention. Instead of constructing an ill-fated legislative solution, this Comment suggests that the shortcoming may be overcome through action at the Patent Office. More specifically, the Patent Office, in promulgating rules relating to its internal operation, may establish a committee to recognize certain public interest organizations for membership in a special program. That program would offer those select organizations\u00bfchosen on the basis of meritorious criteria and for a limited term\u00bfthe opportunity to submit themselves to monetary penalty upon losing an inter partes reexamination. The monetary loss then constitutes an injury in fact, the baseline requirement for appeal from administrative action.",

        "abstract": "Despite their economic significance, little has been done to investigate whether family businesses contribute to wealth inequality. This Article offers the first legal, and one of the only academic, treatments of the topic and shows that family businesses play a double role. On the one hand, family businesses reinforce existing disparities in wealth and opportunity. Heirs, after all, stand to benefit from the hard work of previous generations. On the other hand, family businesses can be a powerful antidote to inequality, disrupting entrenched class hierarchies and creating opportunities for individuals, families, and ethnic communities. This Article concludes that whether family businesses produce net social costs or benefits depends crucially on two principal factors. First, to the extent there is a lack of public investment in social mobility, family businesses can increase the distribution of wealth by providing needed investments in human capital. Second, to the extent the rewards of capitalism are not widely shared, family businesses can offer a source of opportunity for family members, employees, and the communities in which family businesses operate.",

        "abstract": "The concept of possession in property law operates to allocate property rights among competing claimants by awarding the property to the first to take possession. Possession in this context requires an act that communicates to third parties that someone has exercised dominion over the item. Patent law operates in similar ways. The doctrines of novelty and non-obviousness ask, in essence, whether the public was already in possession of the invention prior to the inventor. If so, then the patent application should be rejected. This possession-based view of novelty and non-obviousness offers important insights and prescriptions. As to novelty, the possession framework suggests that the current requirement that the prior art disclose the invention as arranged in the claim is unwarranted. It also suggests that the current doctrine of inherency is wrong. With respect to obviousness, the possession-based approach may be emerging through the Supreme Court\u00bfs reinvigoration of the \u00bfobvious to try\u00bf standard. The possession-based framework also highlights the inconsistent treatment of obviousness as possession in other contexts.",

        "abstract": "This Article examines the relationship between expressive freedom and freedom of conscience as the modern First Amendment took shape. It focuses on efforts by the American Union Against Militarism and National Civil Liberties Bureau\u00bfthe organizational precursors to the ACLU\u00bfto secure exemptions from military service for conscientious objectors whose opposition to American involvement in the First World War stemmed from socialist or radical labor convictions rather than religious scruples. Although such men asserted secular, ethical objections to war, advocates strained to expand the First Amendment\u00bfs Free Exercise Clause to encompass them. Concurrently, they sought to import a generalized theory of freedom of conscience into constitutional constructions of freedom of speech and press, within and outside the courts. The conception of liberty of conscience that they advanced, which they linked to an \u00bfAnglo-Saxon tradition\u00bf of individual rights, clashed with progressive understandings of democratic citizenship and failed to gain broad- based traction.",

        "abstract": "The current complexities of the False Claims Act and the Affordable Care Act have impacted the rise of government enforcement of fraud and abuse laws within health care entities. Yet this rise in enforcement does not adequately address efforts focused on preventing unintentional violations from occurring. This Comment analyzes the peer review privilege established in the Patient Safety Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA), which established a privilege for data collected to improve patient safety, and suggests that a compliance audit privilege fulfills a similar goal. Although there are several differences between patient safety data and compliance audit data, this Comment argues that such differences should not preclude Congress from enacting a compliance audit privilege because compliance and patient safety have compelling similarities. The PSQIA and compliance audits both aim to improve quality and compliance through proactive efforts collecting data, performing ongoing root cause analyses, and encouraging a culture of openness within a health care entity.",

        "abstract": "This Comment examines the prospect of procedural contracts by comparing the text and policies of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Federal Rules). As the existing body of literature addressing the normative desirability and plausibility of contractualized procedure grows, this Comment seeks to add textual and policy-based reasons against uncritically redesigning litigation in arbitration\u00bfs image. Private contracts already govern in the private dispute-resolution arena, particularly in arbitration. This Comment views freedom of contract along a spectrum, where on one end there are non-negotiable mandates set forth for the public to follow, and freely negotiable terms, such as arbitration agreements under the FAA, toward the other end. This Comment comports with existing scholarship in that it views procedure as negotiable to some extent. However, based on its analyses of the text and policies behind the FAA and the Federal Rules, this Comment ultimately concludes that parties should have less procedural modification freedom in litigation than in arbitration.",

The language of the Act clearly prohibits plaintiffs from recovering the same costs under both CERCLA and another comparable state or federal law. This Comment argues that CERCLA\u00bfs double recovery provision should be narrowly interpreted to create economic incentives for parties to shoulder the burdens of hazardous site cleanup. Plaintiffs should be allowed to recover from collateral sources as well as other responsible parties. Because every federal court has prohibited collateral source recovery, this Comment also proposes that courts should not place undue weight on the plaintiff\u00bfs economic benefit from site remediation in double recovery cases.",

The international policy of financial reform has doctrinal implications as well: Congress has supplemented traditional international law with an endorsement of international regulatory cooperation. Because of this supplementation, the things that customary international law used to do\u00bfin particular enabling international cooperation and creating innovation in human rights\u00bfare now being done by financial regulators wielding the power of informal agreements.

This combination results in an overall system we call \u00bfsecret jurisdiction,\u00bf in which individuals wanting to challenge their inclusion on the list are unable to learn the specific evidence against them, the substantive standard for their inclusion on the list, or the process used to put them there. We argue that a traditional procedural due process analysis is insufficient to protect individual rights when national security requires that much of the information relevant to that analysis be kept secret. To counter this deficit, we suggest that courts should incorporate elements of substantive due process by applying a unified due process standard that requires a higher evidentiary burden\u00bfand real evidence of national security benefits\u00bfbefore the government may curtail significant individual liberties.",

Because the Lockean copyright theory offered here accounts for both procedural and consequential goods, it has stronger prescriptive power than the current utilitarian model and can do more work. Also, because Lockean duties lend well to bright-line rulemaking, applying Lockean thinking to legal analysis can streamline litigation. As an example of Locke\u00bfs cash value to copyright law, this Comment expounds upon his thoughts on the natural law duties of property owners and the state\u00bfs role in mitigating transaction costs of private ownership to assign burdens of proof at trial.

Nevertheless, the application of traditional insurance doctrine to school districts has received little attention, either from advocates for changes to the law of liability insurance or from those analyzing trends in tort liability in the public education context. This Comment will propose a reformation remedy that acknowledges the public interest in ensuring compensation for injuries sustained by children as a result of misconduct in the course of education. A reformation remedy would clarify the body of law that has grown around school district misrepresentations by allowing courts to avoid the strained application of alternative legal theories. It would allow insurers to recover their actual losses while also providing coverage for the vulnerable plaintiffs of educational misconduct. Finally, it would ensure a more efficient liability insurance market for school districts by improving the accuracy of pricing for individual school districts and cost spreading across districts with wide disparities in resources.",

        "abstract": "Just over a decade ago, we published an article in the Emory Law Journal titled The Strange Success of Tort Reform, which was inspired by our interest in the possible connection between tort reform and the declining number and rate (per 1000 population) of tort cases. Since that article\u00bfs publication, there has been considerable and continuing distress about the apparent demise of the civil jury trial. In this Article we revisit our earlier argument about tort reform\u00bfs strange success with this concern in mind. In doing so, we agree\u00bfto an extent\u00bfwith those skeptical about a decline in the number of jury trials. At least in terms of auto accident cases\u00bfthe most prevalent kind of tort case and the type of case that accounts for a large proportion of jury trials\u00bfit is not that jury trials are vanishing, it is the cases themselves. We think the important question is more about whether there is something affecting the number of cases that come into the civil justice system, rather than just how they leave it.",

        "abstract": "The story of American federal civil litigation over the past half century is one of exodus and of transformation\u00bfexodus from and transformation of the traditional model of \u00bfcourt litigation.\u00bf The exodus has taken various paths, especially contractual arbitration. Arbitration has become mandatory for claims by consumers and employees. In approving this expansion, the Supreme Court increasingly makes clear that it sees nothing special about court litigation\u00bfthat it and arbitration are mechanisms of equal dignity. Courts today are less often fora for public adjudication and law generation than monuments to mediation. Litigants not cajoled into settlement are hustled through a front-loaded process focused increasingly on adjudication without trial. The driving force of both the exodus from court litigation and its transformation is the perception of excessive caseload. There are not enough Article III judges to do the job in accord with the historical model. Thus, the Court and drafters of the Federal Rules have pursued two safety valves: getting disputes out of the courts and streamlining litigation to foster pretrial resolution. They have pursued exodus and transformation.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, much attention has been paid to the startling disparities in income and wealth in contemporary U.S. society. The implications of this wealth gap reverberate across the socio-legal landscape, but nowhere is the gap more glaring than in the civil docket, where litigation\u00bfparticularly class actions brought by or on behalf of low-income consumers and employees\u00bfis on the verge of disappearing. The unavailability of class litigation is disproportionately more harmful to low-income groups than any other legal impairment, for a number of reasons. As contemporary judges see fewer civil cases brought by or on behalf of poor people, one might expect that they will grow further out of touch with and more ill-equipped to manage these claims; and as this reservoir of wisdom empties, judicial attitudes towards the poor may harden, growing disdainful and ungenerous. Accordingly, when judges are sporadically faced with the legal claims of low income groups, it becomes harder to spot (or easier to ignore) patterns of exploitative, abusive conduct by corporate or governmental actors.",

I predict that there is little chance that the basic structure of Rule 23 will change. Second, I examine the likely state of class action jurisprudence in the year 2026. Third, I focus on the administration and resolution of class actions and offer two predictions: (1) by 2026, a significantly larger number of class action cases will go to trial than at any time since 1966; and (2) technological changes will fundamentally alter the mechanics of class action practice, offering more sophisticated tools for notice, participation by class members, and distribution of settlement proceeds.",

        "abstract": "Adjudication is usually understood as having two functions: dispute resolution and law declaration. This Article presents the process of litigation as a third, equally important function and explains how in litigation, participants perform rule of law values. Performativity in litigation operates in five ways. First, litigation allows individuals, even the most downtrodden, to obtain recognition from a governmental officer (a judge) of their claims. Second, it promotes the production of reasoned arguments about legal questions and presentation of proofs in public, subject to cross examination and debate. Third, it promotes transparency by forcing information required to present proofs and arguments to be revealed. Fourth, it aids in the enforcement of the law in two ways: by requiring wrongdoers to answer for their conduct to the tribunal and by revealing information that is used by other actors to enforce or change existing regulatory regimes. And fifth, litigation enables citizens to serve as adjudicators on juries.",

U.S. government spending on federal regulatory activity in 2014 is estimated to have been $49.8 billion. Federal agencies now employ approximately 284,000 people, and the Code of Federal Regulations now weighs in at over 175,000 pages. Not everyone is pleased with these developments. Chief Justice Roberts, Justices Thomas, Alito, and the late Justice Scalia have expressed their displeasure, indeed their alarm, with consistency, clarity, and vigor. They warn that the rise of administrative agencies, and the attendant ascendance of doctrines of mandatory judicial deference to agency interpretations of federal law, signals no less than the end of our government\u00bfs separation-of-powers structure, and our right to live our lives without fear of bureaucratic encroachment at every turn. As it turns out, however, the same alarm bell was sounded decades ago\u00bfby Roscoe Pound.

While commentators have warned that the declining state of the country\u00bfs infrastructure threatens U.S. prosperity, there is a bigger issue at stake. Decaying urban environments jeopardize the rule of law, undermining the very foundation of the social contract. This Article shows that the strength of the rule of law in a given country can be predicted by that government\u00bfs ability (or inability) to provide public services\u00bfparticularly, a livable urban environment. When urban decay sets in, individuals are led to believe that the government and thus citizens as a collective have abandoned their commitments to following the basic rules governing the social contract. This, in turn, reduces incentives of individuals to engage in lawful behavior. As a result, the rule of law is, like the city itself, left in shambles. In support of this theoretical account, we provide empirical evidence that urban decay weakens the rule of law.",

Less settled is the question of the sorts of works that copyright law seeks to encourage: Ever more copyrightable creations? Only some that are artistically worthy? What makes a work valuable to society? This Article seeks to answer important aspects of these questions by examining them through the lens of information theory, a branch of applied mathematics that quantifies information and suggests optimal ways to transmit it. Using these concepts, this Article proposes that what makes expressive works valuable to society is that they make a contribution in at least one of two principal ways: by using that expression to communicate knowledge\u00bfbe it systematic, factual, or cultural\u00bfand by conveying expression that is enjoyable in and of itself. Information theory sheds light on how copyright law can spur these valuable works.",

        "abstract": "This Comment analyzes the Supreme Court\u00bfs opinion in Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Management District, and critiques the Court\u00bfs language regarding environmental protection and local government regulation. In sum, the Koontz opinion reveals that the Court is unsympathetic to environmental protection at the local level, and is suspicious of local government\u00bfs ability to make reasoned land-use decisions without extorting unfair value from property owners. The Court\u00bfs doubtful attitude regarding the validity of wetlands protection and local government regulation are unsupported by the relevant scholarship. Next, this Comment argues that applying the formulaic takings test prescribed in Koontz has the negative effect of reducing procedural flexibility for local land-use decision-makers. Acknowledging Koontz as the new reality for local governments, local officials will need to adapt to the changes imposed by expanding the Nollan-Dolan test to permit denials, and address the confusion caused by issues the Court left open in the opinion. This Comment recommends a new \u00bfnegotiated permitting\u00bf procedure as a strategy to limit potentially expanded takings liability under Koontz.",

        "abstract": "The landscape of modern organic farming changed drastically with the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Today\u00bfs organic farmer must be constantly vigilant of the threat of GMO cross-contamination. Genetic drift and cross-contamination from GM crops will render organic crops unmarketable, resulting in economically damaged organic programs. Current regulatory systems are unable to protect against the risk of GMO contamination, relegating the judicial system to address the resulting damage. However, many organic farmers who find their crops contaminated are reluctant to seek redress for fear of possible patent infringement suits by the GMO patent owner (typically Monsanto). This is understandable considering that Monsanto continues to find support in the courts when enforcing its patent rights in GMOs. The unique nature of self-replicating GMOs has spurred many legal questions that lie at the intersection of patent owner and organic farming rights. This Comment explores the recourse currently available to the organic farmer harmed by GMO cross-contamination and argues for a new theory of liability: induced nuisance.",

        "abstract": "In the federal court system, when the district courts dismiss shareholders\u00bf derivative actions for failure to allege demand futility, the circuit courts have historically reviewed these dismissals for abuse of discretion. This started to change when the Supreme Court of Delaware converted from deferential to plenary review in 2000. Thereafter, many circuit courts expressed doubt about their historical standard of review. This Comment assembles all the information and analyses necessary for the reader to fully understand the issue and concludes that the courts should preserve the deferential standard. As an intermediate step to this conclusion, this Comment argues that Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure itself--not Rule 12(b)(6) or any other rule--is the proper procedural vehicle for dismissing a case when a plaintiff fails to allege demand futility--the demand futility dismissal. After selecting the vehicle of dismissal, this Comment then turns to the task of assigning a standard of review. To do so, it employs the multifactor test that the Supreme Court handed down in Pierce v. Underwood.",

I was then the Associate Director of the Columbia Law School Project on International Procedure, and one of my assignments was to convince Ben to present to the Advisory Committee a group of rule revisions I had developed relating to transnational litigation, an obscure and arcane matter at the time. That proved a relatively easy sell, and the proposals navigated the statutory rulemaking process successfully.

I argue that a similar transition in judicial role is now occurring. I contend that transferee judges are now stepping back from active participation in settlement discussions but playing a far greater role in structuring and administering the litigation. This new judicial role focuses on facilitating the parties\u00bf resolution of the case, whether through settlement or remand for trial. But as transferee judges increasingly focus upon efficiently directing and sequencing litigation, their procedural and structural decisions can often have unanticipated consequences for the parties\u00bf strategic aims. This Article therefore focuses not only upon identifying the emerging best practices for what I term \u00bffacilitative judges\u00bf in the first days of multidistrict litigation but upon the strategic consequences these practices have for the litigation.",

This Essay argues that the class action procedural device cannot change the fundamental principle that uninjured persons lack standing to have their claims adjudicated by federal courts. To hold otherwise would allow Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 to trump a constitutional imperative, in violation of both due process and the Rules Enabling Act, and would impermissibly expand the jurisdiction of federal courts in violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 82. Before certifying a class, courts should require the named plaintiff to show that absent class member standing\u00bflike any other element of a claim\u00bfcan be proven in a classwide proceeding, and should assess whether proving that absent class members have standing would entail individualized inquiries that preclude classwide adjudication.",

        "abstract": "Class actions have been a feature of the American litigation landscape for over seventy-five years. For most of this period, American-style class litigation was either unknown or resisted around the world. Notwithstanding this chilly reception abroad, American class litigation has always been a central feature of American procedural exceptionalism, nurtured on an idealized historical narrative of the class action device. Although this romantic narrative endures, the experience of the past twenty-five years illuminates a very different chronicle about class litigation. Thus, in the twenty-first century American class action litigation has evolved in ways that are significantly removed from its golden age. The transformation of class action litigation raises legitimate questions concerning the fairness and utility of this procedural mechanism, and whether class litigation actually accomplishes its stated goals and rationales.",

Virtually all of even the serious scholarly work done on the subject has, for the most part, been superficial, failing to pursue, much less to grasp, the practice\u00bfs underlying foundational purposes. The goal of this Article is to seek to understand those foundational purposes. The Article argues that the DNA of the modern class action fundamentally differs from that of the traditional one on-one litigation process. The relationship between class attorney and class member, for example, is significantly different from the normal relationship between attorney and client.",

However, while the Court has made it more difficult for plaintiffs\u00bf attorneys to use class resolution of claims as a prosecutorial tool, the lower federal courts appear to relax certification standards when the parties seek to certify a settlement class. Because of the preclusive power of a class action, which binds all class members who do not opt out, the class action remains a potent settlement tool. The 2014 Randolph W. Thrower Symposium panel that served as the foundation for this paper, \u00bfBinding the Future: Global Settlements and the Death of Representative Litigation,\u00bf asked, however, whether class settlements are bad for class members. This Article begins by analyzing the Supreme Court\u00bfs certification decisions and agrees with most commentators that although class actions are not dead, the device\u00bfs utility as a prosecution tool has been compromised.",

The class action vehicle cannot be used because it is impossible to provide reasonable notice and adequate representation to future claimants. Likewise, nonclass aggregate settlements cannot be deployed because future claimants will not have contacted attorneys whose participation is critical to those alternative methods of dispute resolution. In lieu of class actions and nonclass aggregate settlements, this Article proposes a hybrid public\u00bfprivate claims resolution process designed to provide many of the benefits of global peace, while preserving the constitutional rights of future claimants and ensuring them fair compensation as their injuries manifest.",

Stable marital households, furthermore, are the best way to ensure that men and women are treated with equal dignity and respect, and that husbands and wives, and parents and children, provide each other with mutual support, protection, and edification throughout their lifetimes.

        "abstract": "In 2013, in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., the Supreme Court wrote another chapter in the ongoing story of copyright exhaustion. This ruling is part of a vibrant discourse and a series of recent decisions in high-profile cases, domestically and internationally, regarding the scope of copyright exhaustion and, more broadly, the ability of copyright owners to control the distribution of their work along the chain of commerce. Unfortunately, this discussion rarely explores the modern justifications for copyright exhaustion, which makes it notoriously incoherent and confusing. This Article suggests that copyright exhaustion serves an important social function of reducing information costs. Without it, buyers will need to inefficiently waste resources inquiring whether they will be able to resell copyrighted work. Because resale rights are typically socially desirable, the law should usually provide those rights to buyers. Copyright exhaustion also has costs. The main costs are the reduction in the incentives to create and a regressive distributive effect that are the result of the limitations that copyright exhaustion places on certain price discrimination practices. The balance between these benefits and costs should dictate the scope of copyright exhaustion.",

        "abstract": "The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution embodies the principle of state sovereign immunity, long held to bar suits by private litigants in federal courts or under federal law who seek redress for rights violations at the hands of state governments. But states themselves are not the only prospective defendants shielded by this form of sovereign immunity. As a subset of Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, the arm-of-the-state doctrine allows government entities closely situated to their respective state governments to partake of the state\u00bfs Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity. Unfortunately, this doctrine, both in theory and in application, has been fraught with inconsistency and incoherence since the Supreme Court introduced it in 1977. As a solution, this Comment argues that, rather than the rationales previously offered by the Court, a political accountability rationale ought to guide the arm-of-the-state inquiry. This rationale has been present in the Court\u00bfs sovereign immunity jurisprudence generally but has yet to be substantially incorporated in the arm-of-the-state context.",

While the statute received little attention in its early years, public and private plaintiffs have recently begun to collect large fines and penalties under its jurisdiction. As the number of parties subject to these judgments has continued to grow, the increasing focus on the FTAIA has caused uneven development of the statute: while certain aspects of the FTAIA were defined and refined by judicial interpretation, other language in the statute remained underdeveloped. This Comment proposes a new interpretation of the \u00bfdirect, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect\u00bf requirement of the FTAIA. This new interpretation provides courts with the means to interpret a section of the FTAIA by balancing previous judicial attempts at deciphering the statute with the intent of the members of Congress who drafted it.",

        "abstract": "Title VII\u00bfs prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex is read broadly to include gender nonconformity. Although social scientists have documented the historic link between the homosocial performance of sexual orientation and the achievement of hegemonic masculinity within the modern workplace, courts continue to struggle with the task of defining the scope of protected gender nonconforming conduct. As many within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community continue to demand equal access, recognition, and employment opportunity, only twenty-one states provide statutory protections for LGBT persons or their allies, and courts utilize a number of judicial limits in an attempt to readily distinguish claims based on \u00bfsex\u00bf and those based on \u00bfsexual orientation.\u00bf However well-intended, such tools frustrate the legislative goals underlying Title VII and negate social science that suggests a new, fluid conceptualization of gender normativity is in order\u00bfone capable of recognizing sexual orientation\u00bfs unique role in achieving and reinforcing gender. This Comment proposes the use of an expansive interpretation of sex and what constitutes discrimination based on sex and discourages the imposition of court-crafted limits to the scope of conduct capable of classification as gender nonconforming.",

        "abstract": "The early twenty-first century has witnessed a boom in oil and natural gas production that promises to turn the United States into a new form of petrostate. This boom raises various questions that scholars have begun to explore, including questions of risk governance, federalism, and export policy. Relatively neglected, however, have been questions of why the technological revolution behind the boom occurred and what this revolution teaches about innovation theory and policy. The boom in U.S. shale gas production reflected long-gestating infrastructure developments, a convergence of technological advances, government-sponsored research and development, the presence or absence of intellectual property rights, rights in tangible assets such as land and minerals, and tax and regulatory relief. Consequently, the story behind the boom reaches far beyond the risk-taking and persistence of George Mitchell, whose independent production company achieved pioneering success with hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in Texas\u00bf Barnett Shale. Indeed, the broader story demonstrates how a blend of distinct policy levers, reasonably adjusted over time, can combine to foster a diverse innovation ecosystem that provides a robust platform for game-changing innovation.",

This Article analyzes the critical, yet usually invisible, role of \u00bfreligious interest groups\u00bf\u00bflobby groups representing religious institutions or individuals\u00bfin shaping federal legislation. In recent years, religious interest groups have come to dominate political discourse. Groups such as Priests for Life, Friends Committee on National Legislation, Women\u00bfs Christian Temperance Union, and American Jewish Congress have entered the political fray to lobby for legislative change that is reflective of specific religious values. These religious interest groups collectively spend over $350 million every year attempting to entrench religious values into the law. These groups have become the primary mechanism for religious involvement in federal politics, but, surprisingly, the place and role of these groups has yet to be examined by legal scholars. This Article shows that the key features of religious interest groups reflect significant tensions within the emerging project of religious institutionalism.",

Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code facilitates the creation of security interests in personal property.

The examiner may permissibly rely upon a combination of prior art references to find that a claim would have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art. However, the examiner may not use \u00bfthat which only the inventor taught . . . against its teacher.\u00bf Structural flaws within the examination process place pressure upon examiners to reject claims upon first examination, regardless of the content of those claims. This Comment proposes a framework that focuses on the question of whether an examiner has impermissibly relied upon hindsight to combine references in determining obviousness. This framework provides an avenue for discussion between the patent examiner and the prosecuting attorney and provides substance to be considered by decisionmakers on appeal.",

        "abstract": "The First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects, among other things, the right to the free exercise of religion. In 1990, the Supreme Court held, in Employment Division v. Smith, that valid and neutral laws of general applicability do not violate the Free Exercise Clause. While this decision has reduced the amount of religious liberty protection available to claimants, the decision did leave a silver lining for religious liberty claimants in the form of hybrid rights, which involve the combination of a free exercise claim with another constitutionally protected claim. Because the Supreme Court in Smith did not adequately address hybrid rights, the question remains: when can a combination of protected rights provide religious liberty to a claimant? Three different hybrid rights approaches have emerged: treating Smith as dicta, allowing independent claims, and allowing colorable claims. This Comment argues that the first two approaches completely foreclose the possibility of hybrid rights protection, while the colorable claim approach provides the proper avenue for religious claimants. Then, this Comment makes two arguments for the expansion of hybrid rights.",

        "abstract": "In the past forty years, the U.S. Supreme Court has increasingly advanced the notion that the Fourth Amendment encompasses the common-law restrictions on searches and seizures that existed in 1791 when the Amendment was adopted. Yet, in case after case, the Court has encountered indeterminacy in the common law circa 1791. At times, the Court confronts this indeterminacy by concluding that, in the absence of a clear common-law rule, the Fourth Amendment does not govern the issue. At other times, in the face of indeterminacy, the Court falls back upon general Fourth Amendment principles. And on occasion the Court pretends that the indeterminacy does not exist. The reason for the absence of clear common-law search and seizure rules in 1791 is that the common law differed in important respects among the new American States. More importantly, the Anti-Federalists, those who demanded that the Bill of Rights be added to the Constitution as the price of ratification, recognized that the common law differed by State. This Article introduces a view of the Fourth Amendment\u00bfthe contingent Fourth Amendment\u00bfthat courts and commentators have overlooked. It asserts that we ought to conceive of our rights against unreasonable searches and seizures by federal officials as being largely contingent on state law.",

        "abstract": "The Supreme Court currently operates under the premise that if it finds one part of a law unconstitutional, it can strike down other parts as well. But it is not clear where the Court finds this power to declare laws inseverable. And that lack of clarity has created a doctrinal muddle wherein the Court applies several inconsistent tests. Three such theories are implicit in the current judicial doctrine and academic debate about severability: (1) that it is an equitable remedial power, akin to the power to issue a civil injunction; (2) that it is a variant of intentionalist statutory interpretation, wherein courts strike down further provisions of a partially unconstitutional law so as to preserve the legislators\u00bf hypothetical intentions; and (3) that it is a judicial contract remedy applied to legislative deals. This Article explores these three theories, teasing out their respective logics and showing that they are implausibly broad and inconsistent with Article III of the Constitution. This Article then develops and defends a fourth, narrower theory: that a court can declare a statute inseverable only where the legislature has made one part of the statute conditional on the continued validity of another.",

        "abstract": "This Comment analyzes a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit focusing on the role of an implied good faith inquiry in the \u00bffor cause\u00bf provision in Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The decision in Piazza v. Nueterra Healthcare (In re Piazza) contributes to a purported circuit split on whether the \u00bffor cause\u00bf provision should be the locus for an implied good faith inquiry or whether such an inquiry should be left to other parts of the Code. This Comment argues that the circuit split on the implied good faith inquiry is an illusion. All circuit courts that have examined the issue would likely consider the same behaviors to be grounds for dismissal for bad faith in a future case. The more critical issue for debtors and creditors in bankruptcy is discord among the courts of appeals with regard to the implied good faith test. This Comment argues that multifactor tests like the one endorsed in Piazza are counteractive to the goal of the implied good faith inquiry, namely deterring abuse of the bankruptcy system.",

        "abstract": "Society is consumed with celebrities, and celebrity identity has pervasive power. Two bodies of law are turned to when there is unauthorized exploitation of a celebrity\u00bfs likeness or persona. One, Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, is a federal trademark statute, and the other is the common law right of publicity. Congress designed Section 43(a) to protect consumers from mistakenly believing that a celebrity endorsed a particular product, while the right of publicity centers on the celebrity\u00bfs economic interest in his or her own identity. The interests that both the Lanham Act and the right of publicity are designed to protect must be balanced with the First Amendment interest in free speech. The Ninth Circuit recently decided two cases dealing with this balance. The two cases had very similar fact patterns, but the Ninth Circuit used different tests to analyze the claims, leading to opposite holdings. This Comment advances the novel argument that the Ninth Circuit and other courts should use a new test, combining the transformative use test and a modified likelihood of confusion test when evaluating Section 43(a) Lanham Act claims.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/64/5/comments/shin.pdf",
        "abstract": "Recent neuroscience advances have made it possible to predict illnesses, such as Alzheimer\u00bfs disease, before the onset of any symptoms. This capability is similar to the use of genetic information to predict illness, which began to emerge roughly twenty-five years ago. While predictive information is incredibly useful, the benefits come with a heavy cost. Predictive information can easily be used as a basis for unfair discrimination by health insurance companies, a problem exacerbated by the fact that predictive information is far from perfect. Congress acknowledged and addressed this concern when it preemptively passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to prohibit unfair health insurance discrimination on the basis of genetic information. Congress further reinforced and expanded the protections afforded to predictive genetic information with the passage of the Affordable Care Act. This Comment argues that there is a gap in protection for predictive neuroscience information in the large-group and self-insured health insurance markets. In order to close the gap, this Comment proposes the addition of a health-status-related factor in the Affordable Care Act for predictive neuroscience information.",

        "abstract": "For the last several decades, there have been two constants with respect to the National Labor Relations Board. First, the modern Board has been notoriously reluctant to use its rulemaking authority; until recently, it had made only one significant substantive rule via the notice-and-comment process. Second, commentators\u00bfacademics, lawyers, judges, and politicians\u00bfhave issued a steady stream of calls for the Board to make law via rulemaking rather than through adjudications, arguing for the rulemaking process on both pragmatic and normative grounds. In recent years, however, the first of these has changed: the Board has engaged in two significant rulemaking processes. Each of these processes was both time intensive and politically and judicially fraught, calling into question whether the Board can achieve the process benefits of rulemaking in the current contentious political environment. This Symposium Essay explores the extent to which the Obama Board has been able to achieve the purported benefits of rulemaking, and therefore whether the benefits of making labor law through the rulemaking process exceed the costs, especially where the Board could alternatively make law via adjudication.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/64/special/getman.pdf",
        "abstract": "For eighty years, national labor policy as set forth in the National Labor Relations Act has been committed to overcoming the \u00bfinequality of bargaining power between employees . . . and employers\u00bf by \u00bfencouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining\u00bf and by \u00bfprotecting the exercise by workers of full freedom of association, self-organization, and designation of representatives.\u00bf The basic tenants of national policy may be restated in terms of a series of commands directed at the National Labor Relations Board and the courts. These may be stated as follows: (1) Promote and protect the right of workers to organize for the purposes of collective bargaining. (2) Prevent employers from using their economic power to inhibit free choice by workers. (3) Leave the parties free to negotiate their own agreements. (4) Recognize and protect the right to strike. The key to turning these commands into a living reality was the establishment of the NLRB, an expert agency that was to use its understanding of labor relations reality to establish national labor policy by defining more precisely the general terms of the NLRA subject to minor and supportive review by the courts. When the law was first enacted, its drafters probably assumed that the Court would be instructed in the realities of labor relations by the newly established NLRB and its presumed expertise. That has failed to happen, in part because the expertise of the Board is largely fictional and because the Court regularly ignores and overrides even sensible Board opinions.",

But the Eisenhower administration demonstrated that policy shifts could be initiated through changes in NLRB composition. The Kennedy Board shifted gear again, prompting critics to say that the Board was on a \u00bfseesaw.\u00bf More pronounced polarization began to emerge in the 1980s as political party divisiveness and union decline created more adversarial relationships. In the 1990s, divided government produced a \u00bfbatching\u00bf of appointees (in contrast to annual Senate confirmation votes on each appointment as their term expired), horse trading of \u00bfinterchangeable elites engaged in an insider\u00bfs game\u00bf as Professor Calvin McKenzie said. Ultimately, the consequences of impasse through this process twice resulted in Supreme Court decisions interpreting the Act and the Constitution so as to alter the relationship between the President and the Senate. But the Senate, under Senator Reid, was to trump the practical effect of these holdings by eliminating the filibuster, which frequently stalled or stopped NLRB appointments. Paradoxically, however, through both oversight hearings and the Congressional Review Act of 1996, legislative interference with the work of the NLRB has never been more extensive.",

        "abstract": "Decisions of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), like those of other administrative agencies, are subject to review by the federal judiciary. Standards of review have evolved over time. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 provides that administrative decisions must be in accord with law and required procedure, not arbitrary or capricious, not contrary to constitutional rights, within an agency\u00bfs statutory jurisdiction, and supported by substantial evidence. In practice, more attention is paid to two Supreme Court decisions, Skidmore (1944) and Chevron (1984). For many years Chevron seemed the definitive test. A court must follow a clear intent of Congress, but if a statute is silent or ambiguous on the precise issue, then the court will defer to an agency\u00bfs determination that is a permissible construction of the statute. More recently there has been a revival of interest in the earlier, more flexible Skidmore approach. That would call for considering a variety of factors, including whether the issue was one of \u00bfpure law\u00bf or the application of law to facts and the formality or informality of the agency\u00bfs decisional process. It has even been suggested that these deference tests could be reduced to a single inquiry: was the agency\u00bfs decision \u00bfreasonable\u00bf? Empirical studies have indicated not only that the political backgrounds of NLRB members substantially affect its decisions but also that the political backgrounds of judges substantially affect the decisions of reviewing courts.",

        "abstract": "The NLRA system of collective bargaining was born during the industrial age of the early twentieth century. As a result, key terms in the statute such as \u00bfemployee,\u00bf \u00bfemployer,\u00bf and \u00bfappropriate bargaining unit\u00bf were first interpreted in the context of long-term employment and large vertically integrated firms that dominated this era. Beginning in the late 1970s, the new information technology wrought a revolution in the organization of production increasing short-term contingent employment and the organization of firms horizontally in trading and subcontracting relationships across the globe. To maintain the relevance of collective bargaining to the modern workplace, the interpretation of the key terms of the NLRA must be updated to recognize the changed circumstances of production and interpret union access and employee mutual support in light of the new technology. However, new information technology promises further changes in the workplace with the accelerating mechanization of many jobs and perhaps a fundamental change in the relationship between labor and capital with the development of artificial intelligence. In this Essay, I explore the implications of new information technology for the workplace, the interpretation of the NLRA, and the continuing evolution of American labor policy.",

        "abstract": "The National Labor Relations Board\u00bfs (NLRB) new election procedures represent a comprehensive reform of its representation process. As is the case for many broad reforms, the new rules have prompted significant criticisms and accolades. Many employers have decried the new rules as implementing an unfair \u00bfambush\u00bf election process that will deprive employees of needed information and employers of their right to express their views about unionization. In contrast, unions have largely applauded the new rules as an improvement on an election system that they view as stacked against them. The truth appears far less monumental. Although the NLRB\u00bfs new rules provide a much-needed update to election procedures and aim to decrease many sources of unwarranted delay, they seem incapable of causing a significant impact on employees, employers, or unions. The new rules should result in a quicker election process, but not so quick that they can be fairly described as \u00bfambush\u00bf or a deprivation of employers\u00bf ability to communicate with employees. Moreover, the modestly shorter time periods for elections are unlikely to improve unions\u00bf election win rates or increase union density in a significant way. In short, the NLRB has implemented a modest set of improvements to its representation process, and critics and proponents should not exaggerate the limited impact of those reforms.",

Hodges, the Court will answer whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to license marriages for same-sex couples. While many believe the Court is poised to answer that question affirmatively, assuming it will, it is far less clear how expansive or limited the decision\u00bfs holding will be or what implications will flow from its rationale. At oral argument, Justice Alito pressed the petitioners as to the logical implications of a holding in favor of same-sex marriage, asking, \u00bfSuppose we rule in your favor in this case and then, after that, a group consisting of two men and two women apply for a marriage license. Would there be any ground for denying them?\u00bf Whether a right to polygamous marriage should be recognized as a matter of constitutional or statutory law is a question that we editors of the Emory Law Journal are disinclined to answer ourselves. But we do believe this important question is one worth asking, and Obergefell certainly gives new energy to that conversation. And while questions surrounding polygamy are not new to the academic legal literature, there remains plenty of room for further inquiry and dialogue. Accordingly, in this paper symposium, we have collected a number of articles and essays by leading and emerging scholars to tackle the question of polygamy and its many attendant issues.",

        "abstract": "Questions about polygamy are likely to dominate Western family law in the next generation. Two generations ago, contraception, abortion, and women\u00bfs rights were the hot topics. This past generation, children\u00bfs rights and same-sex rights have dominated public deliberation and litigation. On the frontier of Western family law are hard questions about extending the forms of valid marriage to include polygamy and extending the forums of marital governance to include religious and cultural legal systems that countenance polygamy. This Article analyzes the 1,850 year tradition of Western laws against polygamy and the growing constitutional and cultural pressures to reform these laws today. I show how the traditional Western cases against polygamy and same-sex unions used strikingly different arguments drawn from the Bible, nature, rights, harm, and symbolism. I conclude that, because these arguments are so different, Western nations can responsibly hold the line against polygamy, even if they choose to accept same-sex marriage and its accompanying norms of sexual liberty, domestic autonomy, equality, and nondiscrimination.",

        "abstract": "In this Essay, we argue that civil marriage should not be opened up to multiple parties. Our focus is on civil, not religious, marriage, and we address polygamy in general, rather than any particular form of it. We highlight the important distinction between opening up civil marriage to multiple parties on one hand and recognizing valid foreign polygamous marriages on the other. We contemplate how a country can coherently recognize valid foreign polygamous marriages, while at the same time decline to open up civil marriage to multiple parties. We distinguish decriminalization of polygamy, which we advocate, from opening up civil marriage to multiple parties. We then explain why we believe the rights of children should be a non-issue in deciding whether civil marriage should be opened up to multiple parties. We consider the state\u00bfs continuing interest in marriage in the context of changing social norms and legal developments and conclude that there is a compelling state interest in preserving and supporting civil marriage as a monogamous institution.",

Controlling for the independent effects of Gross Domestic Product and sex ratio, we find statistically significant relationships between polygyny and an entire downstream suite of negative consequences for men, women, children, and the nation-state, including the following outcomes: discrepancy between law and practice concerning women\u00bfs equality, birth rate, rates of primary and secondary education for male and female children, difference between males and females in HIV infection, age of marriage, maternal mortality, life expectancy, sex trafficking, female genital mutilation, domestic violence, inequity in the treatment of males and females before the law, defense expenditures, and political rights and civil liberties. Elevated frequency of polygynous marriage thus tends to be associated with increases in behavioral constraints and physical costs experienced by women and children in particular but also exerts effects that redound poorly to the majority of poor men as well.",

        "abstract": "In Brown v.

A significant factor in this result was the state\u00bfs failure to mount a strong defense of the law, assuming that it could rely on long standing polygamy precedents such as the United States Supreme Court decision in Reynolds v. United States and more recent Tenth Circuit and Utah Supreme Court decisions to justify limiting scrutiny to rational basis and to provide legitimate reasons for the criminalization of polygamy. However, the State could have taken advantage of a then just released Canadian opinion, Reference re: Section 293 of the Criminal Code of Canada (Reference), to explain the real and expansive harms of polygamy. The Reference court undertook an exhaustive examination of the impact of polygamy on women, on children, on men, and on society, utilizing empirical evidence, expert reports, personal anecdotes, and a wide range of \u00bfBrandeis Brief\u00bf materials. This Article argues that the broad range of social and individual harms of polygamy identified in Reference provide a compelling state interest sufficient to withstand the strict scrutiny deemed necessary by Brown.",

        "abstract": "In this Article, Professor Turley explores the concept of social harm in the context of two recent cases in the United States and Canada over the criminalization of polygamy. The cases not only resulted in sharply divergent conclusions in striking down and upholding such laws respectively, but they offered strikingly different views of the concept of harm in the regulation of private consensual relations. Professor Turley draws comparisons with the debate over morality laws between figures like Lord Patrick Devlin and H.L.A. Hart in the last century. Professor Turley argues that the legal moralism of figures like Devlin have returned in a different form as a type of \u00bfcompulsive liberalism\u00bf that seeks limitations on speech and consensual conduct to combat sexism and other social ills. The alternative, advocated in this Article, is the adoption of a Millian approach to harm that requires a more concrete form of injury or harm to justify individual choice. In what he calls the \u00bfLoadstone Rock\u00bf of constitutional analysis, the definition of harm continues to dictate the outcome of the conflict between individual choice and social mores.",

While numerous scholars have written about same-sex marriage, few of them have had much to say about marriages among three or more individuals. As progressive, successful, and important as the Marriage Equality Movement has been, it focuses on same-sex marriage at the expense of other possible kinds of marriages that may be equally worthwhile. The vast majority of Americans still do not discuss plural marriage openly and fairly, as if the topic were taboo. One of the goals of this Article is to convince readers that marriage in the future could be a much more diverse institution that does a better job of meeting individual needs. After all, one size may not fit all. Unfortunately, too often, scholars reduce plural marriage to the exploitation of women and the abuse of children. This approach makes it too easy to dismiss the possibility that a plural marriage might work better than the alternatives for at least some individuals in some circumstances.",

        "fulltext_url": "https://law.emory.edu/elj/_documents/volumes/64/6/marvel.pdf",
        "abstract": "Much of the legal debate surrounding the challenge to \u00bftraditional\u00bf heterosexual marriage has involved questions of liberty, discrimination, and equal treatment. Similar moves have now been made by advocates for polygamous marriage, indicating that polygamous families may be on track to follow in the rainbow contrails of same-sex marriage. This Article argues that such an evolution is indeed likely, but for different reasons than commonly held. Instead, it applies the emerging paradigm of vulnerability theory to a recent suite of polygamy and same-sex marriage rulings, with particular focus on the figure of the \u00bfvulnerable\u00bf child. At the same time, this Article will also consider the legal and social consequences of the mechanics of reproduction within both same-sex and polygamous families. It will ask what the lessons of same-sex parents using assisted reproductive technology (ART) might offer in thinking through the future of polygamy. Plural forms of parentage indicate that we are in a period of marriage evolution, wherein multiple adult caregivers may have a potential claim on the right to parent a given child. These contemporary struggles are already transforming the legal landscape in other countries. The vulnerability analysis will shed light on why it is only a matter of time before they also shift the two-parent mode of caretaking in the United States, given the overlapping vulnerabilities of dependent children, the state, and the institution of marriage itself.",

        "abstract": "Since 2007, the Vulnerability and the Human Condition Initiative at Emory has been developing the concepts of vulnerability and resilience and the idea of the \u00bfvulnerable subject\u00bf as the only appropriate legal subject around which to build law and policy. In the place of an idealized construct based on autonomy, independence, and self-sufficiency\u00bfour present liberal legal subject\u00bfthe vulnerability paradigm recognizes that every actual adult human being, no matter how strong and independent he or she may seem, is both presently and has been in the past reliant on others and on social institutions. The idea of a universal \u00bfvulnerable subject\u00bf to replace the universal liberal subject thus raises new issues, poses different questions, and opens up new avenues for critical and theoretical exploration. Within this emerging body of scholarly inquiry, Stu Marvel\u00bfs Article addresses polygamy, same-sex marriage, and plural parentage by examining the legal response to multiple vulnerable subjects, primarily and most significantly children and the institution of marriage or the marital family.",

        "abstract": "Some Americans are changing the way they pair up, but others aren\u00bft satisfied with pairs. In the last few years, while voters, legislatures, and judiciaries have expanded marriage in favor of same-sex couples, some are hoping for expansion in a different dimension. These Americans, instead of concerning themselves with gender restrictions, want to remove numerical restrictions on marriage currently imposed by states. These people call themselves polyamorists, and they are seeking rights for their multiple-partner relationships. Of course, polygamy is nothing new for the human species. Some scientists believe that polygamy is actually the most natural human relationship, and history is littered with a variety of approaches to polygamous relations. Only in recent centuries has society\u00bfs preference for monogamy developed, yet that preference has proven robust, as most Western governments vehemently support monogamy as the only marital option. This Comment explores polygyny and polyamory in the United States and walks through the traditional legal, political, and sociological arguments for and against polygamy. While some claim the absence of coercion leaves the state without a compelling reason to ban polygamous marriage, this Comment disagrees and finds several compelling reasons for states to favor monogamy.",

While many are fact-specific and malleable, the most foundational one, jurisdiction, is not. The D.C. Circuit recently held that prudential standing, specifically the zone of interests test, is a jurisdictional limitation on the court's power to decide a case. This holding directly contradicts several other circuits, which have held that prudential standing is not jurisdictional and may be waived when the parties fail to raise it. Twenty years ago, this decision likely would not have garnered much attention because jurisdictional dismissals were common for a wide swath of reasons. However, the Supreme Court has recently honed its concept of jurisdiction and has cautioned courts to use the label sparingly.",

Recently, there has been a substantial increase in the amount of money that third parties have invested in commercial lawsuits. Many new investment management groups have been formed in cities such as New York, London, and Sydney looking to finance the endless stream of American litigation. These groups are for-profit entities that fund all or a portion of a plaintiff's legal fees in exchange for a share of any recovery that might result from the underlying lawsuit. The third-party litigation funders, as they are often called, put their \"skin in the game\" by risking the loss of their investment if the underlying claim is unsuccessful.

In a recent project, I interviewed many of the key leaders of the disability rights movement, who confirmed that while they would like to devote more attention to constitutional issues, there is no current short- or long-term constitutional strategy.

In this Article, I put forward a new explanation, one that better elucidates the rise of Silicon Valley as a global trader. Just as nineteenth-century American judges altered the common law in order to subsidize industrial development, American judges and legislators altered the law at the turn of the Millennium to promote the development of Internet enterprise. Europe and Asia, by contrast, imposed strict intermediary liability regimes, inflexible intellectual property rules, and strong privacy constraints, impeding local Internet entrepreneurs. This study challenges the conventional wisdom that holds that strong intellectual property rights undergird innovation. While American law favored both commerce and speech enabled by this new medium, European and Asian jurisdictions attended more to the risks to intellectual property rights holders and, to a lesser extent, ordinary individuals. Innovations that might be celebrated in the United States could lead to imprisonment in Japan. I show how American companies leveraged their liberal home base to become global leaders in cyberspace. I argue that nations seeking to incubate their own Silicon Valley must focus on freeing speech, and so must the United States, if it hopes not to break this new industry.",

        "abstract": "The protection provided by patent rights benefits society by encouraging inventors to disclose their inventions, but these same rights can be wielded against competitors through infringement suits, causing a chilling effect on later innovation. In the field of pharmaceutical innovation, the Hatch-Waxman Act's safe harbor has provided a defense against infringement, allowing generic manufacturers to quickly bring low-cost drugs to the public while trespassing minimally on the patent holder's rights. The Act's delicate balance of benefits and burdens has been threatened by recent judicial interpretations of the provision's scope. The scope of the safe harbor has been expanded to the point that it reduces the value of patent protection for laboratory tools and methods, and in turn threatens the patent system's role in encouraging innovation in these areas.",

        "abstract": "This Article provides the first systematic account of the relationship between campaign finance and federalism. Federalism-a fundamental characteristic of the constitutional structure-depends for its stability on political mechanisms. States and their advocates and representatives in Congress, federal agencies, political parties, intergovernmental lobbying groups, and other political forums work together to check federal interference with state governments. Entire normative theories of federalism depend on the assumption that this system of political safeguards is working effectively in the background. But the federalism and constitutional theory literatures lack a rigorous account of the effects of dramatic political change on pro-federalism political dynamics. Building that account is particularly timely now. Political safeguards work only if states retain significant political influence. But, as recent elections vividly demonstrate, Citizens United has created a new class of political operators,of which Super PACs are emblematic, whose potential political influence may be limitless.",

But, as I will argue, property can promote sociability and inclusion by providing owners with various ways of including others. Owners can assert their \"right to include\" by waiving exclusion rights, dividing existing rights by contracts or property forms, and creating new co-ownership arrangements. Inclusion is socially beneficial insofar as it enables sharing and exchange, facilitates financing and risk-spreading, and promotes specialization.",

However, this flood of legislation has failed to stem the tide of hazing injuries and deaths. The current criminal law approach to hazing has failed because the claimed benefits of specialized hazing laws are illusory. Moreover, the rare cases in which hazing laws provide a benefit over general criminal statutes are the very cases in which the hazing laws are most vulnerable to legal challenge. The current approach also fails on policy grounds. A pure enforcement approach that does not engage with students' values and beliefs about hazing may have the unintended effect of entrenching pro-hazing norms. The creation of sweeping criminal liability also increases the danger of hazing by driving it further underground.",

This research has shown that an abusive household often contains more than one victim, and that an abuser is likely to harm both his intimate partner and domestic animals in the home. The bulk of this research has focused on the degree to which these forms of abuse co-occur, the predictive utility of these statistics, and the effect that animal abuse has on a victim's decision to leave the abusive household. Research findings in these areas have spawned a number of efforts to build upon this link to protect both humans and animals, such as including animals in protective orders, encouraging women's shelters to accommodate companion animals, requiring cross-reporting between animal welfare and domestic agencies, and educating the public as to the potential risk implicated by an animal abuser in the home.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, media companies have struggled to combat the rampant growth of Internet piracy and the sharing of their copyrighted works. Lately, some copyright holders have taken to suing hundreds of file-sharers in a single suit. These suits were initially unsuccessful, as courts denied joinder of the file-sharers. The rise of a unique file-sharing program called BitTorrent, however, has caused some courts to give copyright holders a new opportunity to successfully file and settle these mass infringement lawsuits. A central issue in many of these suits is whether joinder of the many file-sharing users is appropriate. Disagreement among courts over this issue has centered around whether a copyright holder's claims against a group of BitTorrent users \"aris[e] out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences\", as is required for joinder by Rule 20(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This Comment examines the split that has occurred among courts in analyzing this joinder issue and argues that joinder is not appropriate in these suits.",

Evolutionary analysis entails the scientific study of the principles of human nature. Yet, the law's understanding of human nature is not congruent with evolutionary analysis. To be legally provoked under common law for manslaughter mitigation, a homicide must be in response to one of four kinds of provocation: adultery, mutual combat, false arrest, and violent assault. And under adultery, only sexual infidelity counts. Sexual infidelity is not the only type of infidelity that can push a person into a homicidal rage, and while American jurisdictions have started moving away from the rigid categories, sexual infidelity remains a paradigmatic approach for mitigation. The Model Penal Code attempted to make the law more contextual, but it created a new series of adjudications that are expansive and also incongruent with evolutionary analysis.",

        "abstract": "Death-row prisoners have long challenged the methods by which states intend to execute them. Recently, prisoners have begun to challenge revisions made by states to their execution procedures, arguing the revisions violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. But reviewing courts-almost without exception-bar these challenges on statute of limitations grounds. Courts rule that the prisoner's claim accrues shortly after conviction and that the statute of limitations expires shortly thereafter, no matter when the challenged revision was actually made. Method-of-execution challenges are routinely dismissed in this fashion without full consideration of their underlying constitutional merits. This result essentially grants immunity to states and prevents meaningful challenge to revised execution procedures.",

North Carolina decision, in which the Supreme Court held a defendant's age relevant to custody for Miranda purposes, has opened the door for a reevaluation of the dynamics of school interrogations.",

In the past, the U.S. government has enlisted certain banking institutions to serve the needs of the poor and offer low-cost credit to enable low-income Americans to escape poverty. Credit unions, savings and loans, and Morris Banks are three prominent examples of government-supported institutions with a specific focus of helping the low-income. Unfortunately, these institutions are no longer fulfilling their missions, and high-cost, usurious, and sometimes predatory check cashers and payday lenders have quickly filled the void. These fringe banks do not provide the poor with useful credit and further bury them in debt.",

It has failed to adjust to changes in society, technology, and economics, despite individual lawyers' efforts to change their own practices and entrepreneurs' efforts to enter the legal marketplace to serve the needs of middle- and lower-income clients. When change does come, the legal profession is a late-arriver, usually doing no better than catching up to changes around it that have already become well ensconced. This failure robs society of what could be a positive role of the legal profession in times of change, and it deprives the profession itself of being as robust and successful as it could be.",

It builds on a prior body of work about the positive role that property rights in patents can play in commercializing innovation to show how recent shifts in approaches to the particular legal doctrine known as patentable subject matter can be expected to have different effects on the commercialization of inventions than prior approaches. It concludes that, to the extent society wants to increase the overall rate of invention commercialization and increase overall competition as reflected in diversity in firm size among participants in the markets for commercializing innovation, society should consider reversing course on the law of patentable subject matter and return to an approach that is closer to the [opensmartdoublequote]anything under the sun made by man[closesmartdoublequote] view that was championed by the Supreme Court in the 1980s and by Congress through most of the second half of the twentieth century, updating only its gender biased language.",

It also proposes future work to better analyze what we know about these choices and their relative effectiveness, and it discusses new measures to expand our knowledge base, which include: (1) better tracking of government innovation-funding inputs and outputs; (2) better documentation of and self-conscious decision making regarding funding choices; and (3) creating experiments that go beyond existing natural experiments.",

At the core of eyewitness identification is the ability to recognize unfamiliar faces-a memory process that can be distorted by factors intrinsic to the nature of memory, as well as by extrinsic suggestive identification procedures, such as lineups. Because the guilt or innocence of a criminal defendant is often at stake in cases where eyewitness identification is at issue, this potential for distortion is particularly worrisome. In fact, this concern is borne out in statistical data about wrongful convictions in the United States, showing that mistaken identifications are the leading cause of wrongful convictions in the country.",

On the other hand, a lawmaker who votes to repeal a criminal law may be faced with accusations that she is soft on crime.

        "abstract": "The law recognizes the frailty of human nature by mitigating murder to manslaughter when committed in the heat of passion or under extreme emotional disturbance. Evolutionary analysis entails the scientific study of the principles of human nature. Yet, the law's understanding of human nature is not congruent with evolutionary analysis. To be legally provoked under common law for manslaughter mitigation, a homicide must be in response to one of four kinds of provocation: adultery, mutual combat, false arrest, and violent assault. And under adultery, only sexual infidelity counts. Sexual infidelity is not the only type of infidelity that can push a person into a homicidal rage, and while American jurisdictions have started moving away from the rigid categories, sexual infidelity remains a paradigmatic approach for mitigation. The Model Penal Code attempted to make the law more contextual, but it created a new series of adjudications that are expansive and also incongruent with evolutionary analysis.",

Recently, prisoners have begun to challenge revisions made by states to their execution procedures, arguing the revisions violate the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment. But reviewing courts-almost without exception-bar these challenges on statute of limitations grounds. Courts rule that the prisoner's claim accrues shortly after conviction and that the statute of limitations expires shortly thereafter, no matter when the challenged revision was actually made. Method-of-execution challenges are routinely dismissed in this fashion without full consideration of their underlying constitutional merits. This result essentially grants immunity to states and prevents meaningful challenge to revised execution procedures.",

Credit unions, savings and loans, and Morris Banks are three prominent examples of government-supported institutions with a specific focus of helping the low-income. Unfortunately, these institutions are no longer fulfilling their missions, and high-cost, usurious, and sometimes predatory check cashers and payday lenders have quickly filled the void.

        "abstract": "The American legal profession has been a backward-looking, change-resistant institution. It has failed to adjust to changes in society, technology, and economics, despite individual lawyers' efforts to change their own practices and entrepreneurs' efforts to enter the legal marketplace to serve the needs of middle- and lower-income clients. When change does come, the legal profession is a late-arriver, usually doing no better than catching up to changes around it that have already become well ensconced. This failure robs society of what could be a positive role of the legal profession in times of change, and it deprives the profession itself of being as robust and successful as it could be.",

It builds on a prior body of work about the positive role that property rights in patents can play in commercializing innovation to show how recent shifts in approaches to the particular legal doctrine known as patentable subject matter can be expected to have different effects on the commercialization of inventions than prior approaches. It concludes that, to the extent society wants to increase the overall rate of invention commercialization and increase overall competition as reflected in diversity in firm size among participants in the markets for commercializing innovation, society should consider reversing course on the law of patentable subject matter and return to an approach that is closer to the [opensmartdoublequote]anything under the sun made by man[closesmartdoublequote] view that was championed by the Supreme Court in the 1980s and by Congress through most of the second half of the twentieth century, updating only its gender biased language.",

This Article seeks to support better analyses of, and decision making regarding, the choices of government innovation-funding mechanisms by discussing the limits of current analyses and providing a taxonomy of such measures. It also proposes future work to better analyze what we know about these choices and their relative effectiveness, and it discusses new measures to expand our knowledge base, which include: (1) better tracking of government innovation-funding inputs and outputs; (2) better documentation of and self-conscious decision making regarding funding choices; and (3) creating experiments that go beyond existing natural experiments.",

At the core of eyewitness identification is the ability to recognize unfamiliar faces-a memory process that can be distorted by factors intrinsic to the nature of memory, as well as by extrinsic suggestive identification procedures, such as lineups. Because the guilt or innocence of a criminal defendant is often at stake in cases where eyewitness identification is at issue, this potential for distortion is particularly worrisome. In fact, this concern is borne out in statistical data about wrongful convictions in the United States, showing that mistaken identifications are the leading cause of wrongful convictions in the country.",

The suit defied the strategic vision of lawyers at the leading lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) legal organizations--Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), and Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD). Those lawyers had attempted to keep the federal courts away from Proposition 8 and similar state laws. Yet a new organization, the American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER), filed the Perry suit. AFER's effort boasted considerable support from elites and operated within an increasingly favorable legal and political environment.",

If we define judicial self-restraint as a reluctance to declare legislative action unconstitutional and confine the analysis to the 1969-2009 Terms, the answer is no. The Roberts Justices, just as their immediate predecessors, are neither uniform activists nor committed restraintists. Rather, the Justices' votes to strike (and uphold) statutes seem to reflect their political preferences toward the policy content of the law, and not an underlying preference for restraint (or activism). In a nutshell, liberal Justices tend to invalidate conservative laws and conservative Justices, liberal laws. This holds regardless of whether we examine all the Justices' votes simultaneously or each Justice individually.",

        "abstract": "Talk about judicial politics is ubiquitous in the press and academia today. Discussions of this topic, unfortunately, are often vague or inconsistent about the precise meaning of politics in judging. This Essay explores several core meanings of judicial politics to help identify what is, and what is not, inappropriate about politics in the context of judging. The failure to mark differences between these meanings and their implications, I argue, distorts matters and has the potential to undermine our judicial system. The New York Times recently ran an editorial titled Politics and the Court sharply criticizing Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas for trampling the line between law and politics. The Justices effaced this line, according to the editorial, when they took part in a political gathering sponsored by Charles Koch--\"the conservative corporate money-raiser\"--while Citizens United v. FEC was pending before the Court. The Times also castigated Scalia for issuing \"a rambling, sarcastic political tirade\" in a recent dissent. Quoting Professor Lucas Powe's view that Scalia \"is taking political partisanship to levels not seen in over half a century,\" the editorial added that \"Justice Thomas is not far behind.\"",

        "abstract": "Spurred by TiVo Inc. v. Dish Network Corp., this Comment proposes a factor-based framework for determining when contempt proceedings are appropriate in a patent infringement case. Once a court determines that an accused device infringes a patent and issues an injunction, the infringing party will often try to design around the injunction by creating a modified device. Patentees can then respond to potential continued infringement by instituting a new infringement suit or by making a motion for contempt. Previously, under the contempt framework established by KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. v. H.A. Jones Co., the district court was required to undertake a substantial analysis into the propriety of contempt proceedings. Unfortunately, TiVo, which overruled KSM, eliminated the threshold inquiry into the propriety of contempt proceedings and produced a contempt standard that creates a lack of notice, certainty, and consistency that will adversely affect all of the parties involved. A comprehensive contempt framework should provide the district courts with the means of creating a reasoned distinction between modified devices that merit contempt proceedings and those that merit a separate infringement suit. This Comment argues that the Federal Circuit should reinstate the threshold inquiry and proposes a factor-based analysis to strengthen the KSM standard. The result is a comprehensive framework for determining whether contempt proceedings are appropriate that would cure the deficiencies of the TiVo contempt analysis.",

The idea was barely half-baked at the time, but those with knowledge of the law school all gave me a seemingly simple piece of advice: \"You're going to want to speak to David about this.\"",

I had taken that course just the year before--taught by two preeminent scholars--and found it to be one of the most challenging courses in law school.

        "abstract": "Land exhibits a unique duality. Each parcel is at once absolutely fixed in location and inextricably linked to a complex array of interconnected systems, natural and man-made. Ecosystems spanning vast geographic areas sustain human life; interstate highways, railways, and airports physically connect remote areas; networks of buildings, homes, offices, and factories create communities and provide the physical context in which most human interaction takes place. Despite this duality, the dominant descriptive and normative account of land-use law is premised upon local control.",

Juveniles confined in adult facilities face grave dangers to their safety and well-being, including significantly higher rates of physical assault, sexual abuse, and suicide than their counterparts in juvenile facilities. These dangers and other conditions of juvenile confinement with adults give rise to concerns of constitutional dimension. In its Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, the United States Supreme Court has created categorical rules prohibiting the imposition of certain punishments on entire categories of offenders as cruel and unusual punishment.",

Courts and commentators recognize the issue\u00bfs importance, but cannot agree on the purpose that limits on personal jurisdiction serve, which clauses in the Constitution (if any) supply those limits, and whether current doctrine implementing those limits is coherent. This Article seeks to reorient the discussion by developing a framework for thinking about why and how the Constitution regulates personal jurisdiction. It concludes that principles animating the emerging field of horizontal federalism\u00bfthe constitutional relationship between states\u00bfshould guide jurisdictional rules and instigate sweeping reevaluation of modern jurisprudence. In particular, the Article questions two pillars of the Supreme Court\u00bfs jurisprudence. More generally, the Article creates a framework for thinking about personal jurisdiction that ties the subject into analogous debates about ostensibly distinct areas of constitutional law and provides a foundation for testing competing normative critiques of modern doctrine.",

Rather than subject the defendants to these unfair burdens, the Court struck language from a fifty-year-old precedent, Conley v. Gibson, that would have allowed the suits to proceed. The Court\u00bfs solution created three new problems. Lower court judges found little guidance in its new, amorphous \u00bfplausibility\u00bf standard. Critics argued that Twombly and Iqbal would lock the gates to the federal courts. Even the decisions\u00bf supporters bristled at the Court\u00bfs cavalier treatment of precedent.

However, the recent foreclosure crisis and related economic collapse exposed vulnerabilities in the developed system of homeownership and mortgage financing\u00bfvulnerabilities so deep that they have left whole neighborhoods abandoned, and shaken economic stability across every income bracket. As a result, some analysts have begun to seriously question the virtues of\u00bfand sometimes to blame\u00bfpolicies that incentivize homeownership for people who traditionally cannot afford it. This Comment presents an existing model of affordable homeownership that has weathered the housing collapse with astounding resilience: the Community Land Trust (CLT).

Legal protections usually depend on whether an individual is operating within a particular time period, physical space, or other context. The assumption underlying this targeted approach to state response is that the law must make distinctions between individuals that both determine eligibility for legal protections and possible remedies. In litigation, this approach may be perceived as necessary to promote fairness amongst adversarial parties. Targeted approaches may also facilitate desired judicial outcomes, by expanding, contracting, or reframing liability. Laws structuring social welfare programs or other access to material resources may target certain populations to control public expenditures.

This new legal-political regime was rooted in three interlinked developments: the centralization of public power; the individualization of private right; and the constitutionalization of the rule of law. Beginning soon after the Civil War, nineteenth-century common law understandings of the public obligations of associative communities in a confederated republic were increasingly replaced by a new emphasis on the constitutional rights of individual citizens in a nation-state\u00bfa nation-state insistently expanding its general police and regulatory authority.",

This Article embarks upon the project of identifying which Supreme Court opinions have proved the most legally significant and exploring why. We employ an analysis of citations to opinions.

In such situations, laypersons are likely to make suboptimal decisions that sometimes aggregate into systematic failures, from soaring health care costs to market crashes. In the end, the presence of an unbiased advisor is the strongest determinant of layperson performance, and thus policymakers must develop ways of aligning the interests of advisors and laypersons.

        "abstract": "This Article describes and evaluates the evolution of rights doctrine in the United States, focusing on the problem of balancing. In the current Supreme Court, deep conflict over whether, when, and how courts balance rights is omnipresent. Elsewhere, we find that the world\u00bfs most powerful constitutional courts have embraced a stable analytical procedure for balancing, known as proportionality. Today, proportionality analysis (PA) constitutes the defining doctrinal core of a transnational, rights-based constitutionalism. This Article critically examines alleged American exceptionalism, from the standpoint of comparative constitutional law and practice.",

        "abstract": "In the wake of the economic crisis, state budgets have been devastated by substantial decreases in revenue. A traditional source for raising revenue is increased taxes, but raising taxes carries a political stigma legislators prefer to avoid. Instead of (or in addition to) raising taxes, states often seek alternative sources of revenue through their unclaimed property laws. Unclaimed property laws incorporate the doctrine of escheat, which entitles a state to take custody of property that has remained unclaimed by its owner for a designated period of time. In the past twenty years, states have expanded their escheat laws and increased collection efforts to capture more unclaimed property as an alternative source of revenue. An example of this trend are states\u00bf attempts to capture the remaining value on gift cards, which independently are often small amounts but, in the aggregate, constitute a substantial sum ripe for the taking.",

Congress enacted 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 to remedy problems of this sort by lifting the shield of immunity when a state actor violates an individual\u00bfs constitutional rights. A credible threat of liability for police officers is imperative to encourage police to act in a way that protects individuals from harm. However, the Supreme Court has substantially limited the possible \u00a7 1983-based causes of action a victim of gender-based violence can bring against a police officer. The only remaining avenue for liability is an equal protection claim. However, equal protection challenges have met such consistent rejection in the lower federal courts that many scholars believe they are not a tenable strategy for police accountability.",

This Article argues against expert judgment as the means of linking general social science to specific cases, and for the use of methodologically rigorous case-specific research to produce \u00bfsocial facts,\u00bf or case-specific evidence derived from social science principles. We explain the many ways that social fact studies can be conducted to yield reliable case-specific opinions, and we dispel the view that litigation poses insurmountable barriers to the conduct of case-specific empirical research. Social fact studies are feasible for both plaintiffs and defendants, and they provide much sounder conclusions about the relevance of social science to a litigated case than does linkage via expert judgment.",

That research concludes that collective or communal ownership of CPRs may be optimal in certain circumstances.

The idea that such a movement might occur, and what form it should take, is ripe for consideration and evaluation. In this Article, I use an initiative currently being advanced by a community of Maine lobstermen to create and illustrate a model that might be broadly used for the recognition of group-level property rights in communities, or other groups, that are the de facto stewards of CPRs.",

For a martial artist, a proportional use of force should rarely require killing the aggressor because martial artists possess special fighting skills that are designed to subdue opponents without killing them.

When the foreign plaintiffs hail from Latin America, however, their home forums are often unavailable following an FNC dismissal due to the Latin American courts\u00bf interpretation of their own preemptive system of jurisdiction. To make this clear and prevent U.S. courts from dismissing for FNC, numerous Latin American countries recently have enacted \u00bfblocking statutes,\u00bf explicating that a Latin American court cannot exercise jurisdiction over a case dismissed abroad under the FNC doctrine.

First, it uses case studies to illustrate valuable lessons about the challenges of creating effective natural resource management. Second, the Article is anchored in the specific implications of climate change, considering the value of interagency information sharing and adaptive governance in addressing climate effects. Third, it engages the growing theoretical literature on adaptive management and federalism.

This Comment focuses on one manifestation of the conflict between same-sex rights and religious liberty: the conflict that arises when individuals and organizations are compelled by their religious beliefs to violate state civil rights statutes protecting same-sex couples. Such violations expose them to civil liability for acting in accordance with their religious beliefs.",

This new, independent agency would be charged with investigating and reviewing the inaction of Executive Branch agencies and reporting its findings and recommendations to elected officials and the public. The FIC would provide many of the same benefits that would result from increasing the availability of judicial review of non-enforcement decisions and other regulatory inaction. At the same time, the FIC would be in a position to minimize the practical disadvantages that have been identified with judicial review of such decisions. Not only would the establishment of the FIC therefore provide a more workable solution to the problem of agency inaction than other commentators have offered, but the agency would also provide a political solution to what the staunchest defenders of the status quo have maintained is solely a \u00bfpolitical\u00bf problem.",

Although the Supreme Court has consistently held that violations of the public trial right belong to an exceedingly small class of constitutional errors requiring reversal, appellate courts persist in upholding improper courtroom closures even when the record shows that courts below have violated the applicable constitutional standard. When criminal trials are fatally fouled by structural, constitutional error of this kind, the reluctance of appellate courts to reverse is damaging in two ways\u00bfit encourages repetition of the same mistake, and it denigrates core values of individual rights that underlie our system of justice. This Comment argues for corrective action by explaining the rules governing courtroom closure, highlighting the errors often made by trial and appellate courts, and detailing the legal basis for more rigorous enforcement of the public trial right.",

Such a strategy should again be employed to address overconsumption and over-marketing of high calorie food at restaurants, as well as to remedy the patchwork of menu labeling requirements that has been created in recent years and continues to expand.

This decision raises the question whether the Court will apply a similar constitutional limit in future punitive damages cases. In the meantime, lower courts have already begun to rely on Exxon Shipping as persuasive authority for limiting punitive damages further than the Supreme Court\u00bfs previous cases require. This Comment argues that Exxon Shipping\u00bfs one-to-one cap in maritime cases is inconsistent with key principles of punitive damages law, advises against the application of Exxon Shipping\u00bfs one-to-one cap in non-maritime cases, and explains why the Supreme Court should not enact a similar cap on punitive damages in future constitutional cases.",

We argue that the state should independently protect both intimate relationships and sexual interactions because sex can constitute a vital part of individual identity and self-expression even when not channeled into intimacy. We challenge the dominant, almost sacred, understanding that the most important relationships between adults should always be both sexual and emotionally intimate.",

Our findings reveal that the impact of an ISS recommendation is reduced greatly once company- and firm-specific factors important to investors are taken into consideration.

This Article articulates the need for a nuanced approach to tort law in the realm of child\u2013parent conflict\u2014an approach that shifts the social and economic burdens of infant and child harms to parents because they are best situated to avoid the risks of harm. This Article addresses a gap in socio-legal scholarship to unpack when, how, and why tort liability should apply to ART cases. It also anticipates the expanded application of tort theories in traditional intra-familial contexts.",

They shape major life decisions, such as whether to marry and how many children to have, as well as everyday decisions, such as how to discipline children and divide household labor. Emotion is a defining feature of these familial social norms, giving force and content to norms in contexts as varied as reproductive choice, parenting, and same-sex relationships. These emotion-laden norms do not stand apart from the law. Falling along a continuum of involvement that ranges from direct regulation to choice architecture, state sway over social norms through their emotional valence is an under-recognized aspect of the family-state relationship.",

Elaboration of certain assertions and terms would strengthen her observations and arguments, making both more persuasive. In the following Parts, I raise some key issues and questions regarding the concepts and terms that warrant further development and articulation.",

The need for an appropriate balancing test is confirmed by recent lower court opinions that have struggled to justify a deferential approach in the face of employment decisions by religious institutions that violate federal law and lack any religious justification.

After situating the closed rule within its institutional and theoretical context, this Article examines the use of the closed rule by the Republican majority in the 109th Congress and the Democratic majority in the 110th Congress. The Article then undertakes both a positive and normative analysis. The positive analysis generalizes three prominent accounts of the closed rule from political theory and argues that the closed rule can more accurately be understood as a broadly managerial instrument for maintaining order on the House floor. The normative analysis identifies and discusses several undesirable effects of the closed rule\u2014its tendency to increase legislative fragmentation and redundancy, its facilitation of third-party capture, and its weakening of bipartisan cooperation and compromise.",

We do so from the perspective of legal and positive political theory, and we interrogate various institutional devices (such as constitutionalism and the independent judiciary) in order to shed light on how the construct of the rule of law is being put into service on behalf of cross-national reform initiatives.",

If advocates want clear strategies for reform and scholars cannot offer them, the two worlds may understandably grow apart. But it does seem that our desire for reform has gotten out in front of the science that should support it. This does not mean that we should scrap the rule of law concept or give up on trying to reform states that systematically violate rule of law values. On the contrary, like MRW, I believe strongly that the rule of law is a worthy aspiration, and I am optimistic enough to believe that the science can catch up to our reform interests. That said, The Rule of Law Unplugged demands that we carefully reconsider the ways that we research the subject and ultimately advocate for change.",

Congress should also remove sentencing limits and explicitly grant tribal courts authority to adjudicate all crimes. Accordingly, this Comment discusses the effects of present legal hurdles to prosecuting those who commit crimes in Indian Country. It shows how Congress could remove these legal barriers and addresses possible constitutional concerns about this proposal. This Comment outlines the legal benefits of this proposal, including a more harmonized and modern legal framework that enhances tribal institutions and sovereignty. This Comment also articulates the law enforcement benefits of greater reliance on tribal authorities, and it explains why tribes are better equipped than states to respond to sexual violence and why an indigenous response to rape is crucial to strengthening tribal institutions.",
